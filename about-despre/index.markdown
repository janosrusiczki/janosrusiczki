<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-621" title="János Rusiczki" src="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/janos-rusiczki-150x150.jpg" alt="János Rusiczki" width="150" height="150" /> Well, hello there and thanks for stopping by!</p>
<p>My name is János Rusiczki and this is my personal space on the Internet, but you probably figured this out already. The guy in the blinding red t-shirt posing in the picture on the left is me, you caught that right too. So it would be around time to get down to some lesser known facts:</p>
<p><strong>Birthday:</strong> April 17, 1979;<br />
<strong>Location:</strong> <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=47.6522&lon=23.5652&zoom=13&layers=M">Baia Mare, Romania</a>;<br />
<strong>Working as:</strong> Freelance web developer - <a href="http://www.link7.ro">Portofolio</a></p>
<h3>Random things, all about me</h3>
<p>Musicwise I prefer <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_dance_music">EDM</a>.</p>
<p>I like dogs almost as much as I love cats. I love tea but almost never drink coffee. I replace coffee with Coke or Pepsi when available although I know very well that these are much worse than coffee itself.</p>
<p>I usually enjoy <em>less than usual</em> movies and don't really like horror, generally violent or just dumb movies. I removed a hefty list of movies and actors from here because I'm really bad at making lists and I'm sure that I'd forget something or someone important. The important thing is that I listen to lots of music (sometimes even while I sleep) and watch as many movies as I can fit in my schedule and am able to put my paws on.</p>
<p>I used to prefer <a href="http://www.holsten.com/">Holsten</a> when it came to beers but nowadays I'm not that sure...</p>
<p>In case you were wondering the picture above was taken by my girlfriend in her grandmother's living room and I'm wearing a Threadless t-shirt called <a href="http://www.threadless.com/product/607/No_More_Bento?streetteam=rev">No More Bento</a>. Oh!? You weren't? Anyway, now you know.</p>
<h3>About the site</h3>
<p>Back in the day it was built using <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/">Movable Type</a> with lots of customizations and homebrewn scripts. Original color palette help by Meister <a href="http://www.adnan.ro/">Adnan</a>. Additional styling help and some header graphics by <a href="http://www.lucianmarin.ro/">Luci</a>. The link blog section, when it existed, was powered by <a href="http://delicious.com/">delicious</a> via their sweet RSS feed. Buttons on the left were stolen from here and there, but mostly from <a href="http://gtmcknight.com/buttons/">here</a>. The 'Cruel World' section just above the buttons listed commercial sites that I was promoting for various reasons.</p>
<p>Nowadays it's built upon WordPress with a fairly customized template. You can find more information about the upgrade in <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/02/keeping-up-with-the-times/">this post</a>.</p>

Well, hello there and thanks for stopping by!

My name is János Rusiczki and this is my personal space on the Internet, but you probably figured this out already. The guy in the blinding red t-shirt posing in the picture on the left is me, you caught that right too. So it would be around time to get down to some lesser known facts:

**Birthday:** April 17, 1979;

**Location:** [Baia Mare, Romania](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?lat=47.6522&lon=23.5652&zoom=13&layers=M);

**Working as:** Developer at [SoftVision](http://www.softvision.ro)

### Random things, all about me

Musicwise I used to prefer electronic (dance) music (not EDM) but nowadays I'm more like an omnivore.

I like dogs almost as much as I love cats. I love tea but almost never drink coffee. I replace coffee with Redbull when available although I know very well that it is much worse healthwise.

I ditched my Cola addiction in the spring of 2014.

I usually enjoy _less than usual_ movies and don't really like horror, generally violent or just dumb movies. I removed a hefty list of movies and actors from here because I'm really bad at making lists and I'm sure that I'd forget something or someone important. The important thing is that I listen to lots of music (sometimes even while I sleep) and watch as many movies as I can fit in my schedule and am able to put my paws on.

I used to try out new beers, but then I stopped drinking alcohol completely around the summer of 2015.

In case you were wondering the picture above was taken by my girlfriend in her grandmother's living room and I'm wearing a Threadless t-shirt called [No More Bento](http://www.threadless.com/product/607/No_More_Bento?streetteam=rev). Oh!? You weren't? Anyway, now you know.

I collect vinyls and LEGO sets.

### About the site

Back in the day, the first iteration of this site was built using [Movable Type](http://www.movabletype.org/) with lots of customizations and homebrewn scripts. Original color palette help by Meister [Adnan](http://www.adnan.ro/). Additional styling help and some header graphics were done by [Luci](http://www.lucianmarin.ro/). The link blog section, when it existed, was powered by [delicious](http://delicious.com/) via their sweet RSS feed (delicios is now long dead / read-only). 

In the second iteration it was built upon WordPress with a fairly customized template. You can find more information about the upgrade in [this post](http://www.rusiczki.net/2009/04/02/keeping-up-with-the-times/).

Nowadays, as a sort of a back to the roots statement, it's generated by Jekyll.

This site now rocks **{{ site.posts | size }}** posts.

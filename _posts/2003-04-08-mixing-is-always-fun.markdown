<p>I had some fun with <a href="http://www.nativeinstruments.de/" title="The coolest mixing software for PC">Traktor</a> this morning and damn I was good! I made an almost perfect mix. And even if it wasn't perfect, it banged! Because I've chosen the tunes wisely. I'm a little ashamed of myself because I only mixed progressive house and trance (because these are easy to mix: long track times and mostly the same beat and BPM in each track) but it was a lot of fun. That's why I missed the first class in school. :-)<br />
But the musical experience will continue on my way to school. Well of course, with Massive Attack...</p>

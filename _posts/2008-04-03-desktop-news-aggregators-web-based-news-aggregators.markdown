<p>I noticed that lately I started preferring desktop feed readers to web based ones.<br />
First I discovered that <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/FeedDemon/">FeedDemon</a> is nowadays free. Then I discovered that <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/individuals/netnewswire/">NetNewsWire</a> is also free nowadays. Then I discovered that since they're owned by the same company they're able to synchronize via NewsGator which provides <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NewsGatorOnline/">NewsGator Online</a> - a basic web based aggregator. What else would I need? I quickly imported all my Bloglines (the first web based service I used way back) feeds into FeedDemon and later merged them with the OPML exported from Google Reader (the one I've been using until recently) in NetNewsWire and BAM! Here I am, in geek heaven. Truth to be told, NetNewsWire crashed several times because I was rushing to organize my feeds while they were still downloading but after I managed to fit each one into the folder it belonged to now everything is OK.<br />
So excuse me while I'm pounding away on the space bar catching up with all my favorite blogs, reads, comics and photos. See you all later.</p>

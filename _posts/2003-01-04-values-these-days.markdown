<p>One more thought about the NYE party and then I'll burry the thought. I'll try at least.<br />
The intro. There were these kids with us at the party. 15 - 16 years. Girls mostly. Plus one guy. Being drunk, I spotted one of the girls sitting there very sad. Having nothing else to do I went to cheer her up. It looks like I've succeded because yesterday I received an SMS in which she was telling me that I'm such a 'cool guy' that I made her happy then.<br />
Well this got me thinking. If it only takes this to be a 'cool guy' then I could be a 'cool guy' really often. But then I thought about what does actually 'cool guy' mean for kids of this age... Answer: nothing really. Just as the word 'friend' doesn't really mean anything to them either.<br />
Maybe I shouldn't think so much about stupid little things like this. Hehe.</p>

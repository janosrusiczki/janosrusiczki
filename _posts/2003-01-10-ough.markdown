<p>I don't have the power to start learning economics now.<br />
I spent all day writing code for three administration sections of an upcoming site. My brain is smoked out. Dead. I'm reading that stuff. But it's just as I would be looking at the empty, white, paper.<br />
It's snowing heavily outside. So whatever happens tomorrow at the exam AND if the weather stays the same, I'll surely take another dose. This time I'm taking my camera with me. I just don't know how to pack it to ensure that I won't break it. Well. I'll see.</p>

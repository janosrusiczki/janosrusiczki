<p>Well I found <a href="http://www.orange-today.co.uk/news/story/sm_732378.html?menu=news.quirkies" title=":)">this article</a> very funny:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>A Brazilian woman, shot in crossfire between police and drug dealers, was saved by her silicone breast implants.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>I think police should have the female officers implanted with silicone instead of having them wear kevlar wests. Well. No. The conclusion is the funniest however:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>A plastic surgeon was called in to fix the damage and took the opportunity to increase the size of Mrs Soares' breasts with more silicone.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Got so much stuff to blog about but my energy level is painfully low...<br />
Just wanted to note that I was getting tired of all the spam comment notifications that were landing in my mailbox so I installed <a href="http://appnel.com/kb/mtakismet/mtakismet-manual">MT-Akismet</a>. For the time being, the comments will remain moderated but if the plug-in performs well, I'll open them again.<br />
I'll be back after some well earned sleep.<br />
<strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.rd.com/health/mind-and-body/sleep/12-tips-to-create-a-sleep-haven/article54358.html">Perfect timing.</a></p>

<p>The title is obviously a pun, as <em>someone</em> is so obsessed with SEO... :-)</p>
<p>I helped my friend <a href="http://www.lucianmarin.ro">Luci</a> with his site's redesign. As in XHTML & CSS by your's truly. It was a simple and pleasant job, unfortunately interrupted several times by <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2009/01/26/a_bitter_update">my recent problems</a> and inherent laziness. But the good news is that it's ready now. At least the homepage...</p>
<p>Tatadaaam!</p>

<p>Clicking on the image above will take you to his site. Plus I have <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/lucian-marin-website-screenshot.png">the full version</a> of the above screenshot archived for eternity, so we'll always know how the site looked on January the 30th, 2009.</p>
<p>PS. Resize those damn goodies images!</p>

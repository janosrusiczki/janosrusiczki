<p>Mickey Mouse was great!<br />
It's so sad that there's nothing on <a href="http://www.daypop.com">Daypop.com</a> about the Oscars. It seems that the whole weblog community is concentrating on the war. Fortunately a <a href="http://www.feedster.com/search.php?hl=en&ie=ISO-8859-1&q=oscar&btnG=Search">search</a> on <a href="http://www.feedster.com">Feedster</a> doesn't show such sad results...<br />
Best supporting actress, two nominations from Chicago, and... One of them wins, of course. It's <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Zeta-Jones%2C+Catherine">Catherine Zeta-Jones</a>. Who's pregnant... Wow!<br />
Haha. Alias Wavefront's Maya... An achievement indeed...<br />
Frida's music sounds great! (The score I mean.) And Salma "I started as an actress in a soap opera" Hayek looks great!<br />
Sound. I put my tip on Lord of The Rings. Chicago... Whooops.<br />
Sound editing. OK. My tip is again on Lord Of The Rings. Bingo this time! :-)<br />
First anti-war speech.</p>

<p>I rarely write about music lately but this time I just have to.<br />
I first heard this tune in a <a href="http://www.traxsource.com/index.php?act=page&page_id=13">Traxsource mix</a> by John Cutler back in August, and almost instantly I fell in love with it and the craving started. I knew I just needed the song. So, most evidently I started digging around and soon enough I found <a href="http://www.tejalrecords.com/">Tejal Records</a>. Then I found <a href="http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendID=58924014">Fudge's MySpace profile</a> and sent him a message asking when will the song be available in downloadable format and he responded and assured me that in a few short weeks. Well, since then I've been checking the Traxsource newsletter like crazy. As it turns out I shouldn't have because there it was, right at the top of their latest e-mail. So I got it yesterday. And now here I am, happily listening it every 30 minutes.<br />
You can listen to the song either on Tejal Records or on his MySpace profile and you <a href="http://www.traxsource.com/index.php?act=show&fc=tpage&cr=titles&cv=5355">can get it from Traxsource</a>.</p>

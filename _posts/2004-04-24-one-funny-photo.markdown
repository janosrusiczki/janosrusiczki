I succeeded yesterday and almost accidentally shot a really funny one. I was out in the garden trying to photograph the signs of spring namely the blooming flowers on the peach trees and magnolia flowers and then I approached the "house guard" dog. And as he tried to smell the camera I pressed the shutter button. You can see the result on the left. I think it's at least hilarious. :-)</p>

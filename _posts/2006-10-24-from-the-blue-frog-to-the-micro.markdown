<p>Yep. This morning after reading <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71979-0.html">a review on Wired</a> I gave in and installed <a href="http://www.utorrent.com">&micro;Torrent</a>. My old friend, <a href="http://azureus.sourceforge.net">Azureus</a> remains installed but from the looks of it not for long. Because after ignoring my work colleague's continuing raving recommendations and hype for about a year I finally gave it a try and found &micro;Torrent to be a BitTorrent client that's super fast and responsive and doesn't gobble up my precious memory for breakfast. So, adieu resource hog Java, welcome &uuml;ber fast C++.</p>

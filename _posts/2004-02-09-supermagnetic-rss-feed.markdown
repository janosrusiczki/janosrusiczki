  content: ! 'Yep. It was me.

    I made it on such short notice because at least from now on I''ll read the news
    too. I was lazy to load IE just for supermagnet. In fact I try to avoid loading
    IE no matter what. :-)

    The head-honchos are still trying to figure out some meaningful titles for the
    news in the feed because the current ones aren''t super enough for them. :) And
    maybe there''ll be other changes too. That''s why it''s a beta.

<p>Because I obviously have too much time on hand (the day after tomorrow, the 11th of February 2004 AD, is the date set for my management re-examination) I made <a href="http://www.supermagnet.ro/rss.php" title="Add this to your favourite news aggregator...">a valid RSS 2.0 feed</a> for the so-called supernews on <a href="http://www.supermagnet.ro">supermagnet.ro</a>.<br />
Let's call it a beta for now.</p>

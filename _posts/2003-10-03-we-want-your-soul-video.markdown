    When i heard Adam Freelance: We Want Your Soul, I knew i had just listened to
    a song that i as going to keep in my collection forever. One of those Vinyls that
    you treasure and hide from your friends to keep it safe. Then after seeing the
    amazing video clip on cable tv, i knew i could most likely get it on the net.
    Well after a few hours of frustrated searching and bad links, i finally came across

It's a really cool one. I haven't seen many good music videos lately. In fact I haven't seen any memorable music videos lately. But I'm not watching music tv channels so much anymore. And if I am, I most probably tune in to VH1 which usually broadcasts music which matches my taste at least as long as it comes to music broadcasted by music tv channels.<br />
Lately I listened a lot to the minidiscs I recorded with <a href="http://drumandbass.ro/dnb/artists/dj_dubase/" title="DuBase's profile @ DrumAndBass.RO">DuBase's</a> performance last weekend and I dug up an older mixed CD I got from <a href="http://drumandbass.ro/dnb/artists/infamous_massive/" title="Seb's profile at DrumAndBass.RO">Seb</a> which slowly grew on me to the point that I like it a lot now and listen to it almost every day. At least parts of it depending on my time. Great job pal! :)<br />
<b>UPDATE</b> The download link is gone since it was generating way to much traffic over at <a href="http://www.drumandbass.ro">drumandbass.ro</a> and the guys who host the site for free started complaining... Sorry.</p>

<p>Damn, I'm up very late again! And I don't know if I'll be able to go to school tomorrow or I'll just lay lazily in my bed. I guess I'll force myself somehow... Here's the link harvest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Here's <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00000JFU4/ref=sr_aps_music_1_1/202-6187050-3357435">an album</a> one of my friends (actually my "best friend") would surely love a lot, since it contains almost all the theme tunes of the shows played on Cartoon Network.</li>
<li>Lots of weird stuff (pics and stories) on <a href="http://www.anomalies-unlimited.com/">Anomalies Unlimited</a>. From the few I browsed I found <a href="http://www.anomalies-unlimited.com/Prayer.html">this carving</a> of the Lords Prayer on the head of a pin the most interesting. The poor guy went blind doing it...</li>
<li>I like horror books so I saved <a href="http://www.bookfilter.com/index.cgi?i=view&id=52&f=1">this page</a> from <a href="http://www.bookfilter.com/">BookFilter</a> for further reference.</li>
<li>This is the fourth entry to justify somehow that I'm up at 3 AM browsing and I have to wake up in 5 hours. This <u>sounds</u> bad. And it won't <u>feel</u> one bit better.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll sleep most of the day tomorrow I can be sure of that. At least I hope I'll attend the Mathematics class...<br />
Bed time!</p>

<p>Really. My life turned quite boring... My schedule turned upside down: sleeping during the day, awake through the night. As a direct result I'm obviously not attending school as I should. I received my <a href="http://www.dms3.com">DMS3</a> modchip but when I saw the size of the points I'm supposed to solder it to I chickened out. I think I'll take my PS2 to Timisoara and have a so called 'pro' mod it. Yes, this weekend I'm off to the lovely Timisoara. In fact I'll go to Cluj first (on Thursday) and then Timisoara. That'll be nice for a change.<br />
What else? Future Prophecies' <i>Miriamba</i> is great and Black Sun Empire's <i>Driving Insane</i> LP is nice too. <a href="http://www.fairvue.com/?feature=awards2004">The winners</a> for this year's Bloggies are out, I left a (hopefully) helpful <a href="http://www.scriptygoddess.com/archives/004902.php#comments">comment</a> over at <a href="http://www.scriptygoddess.com/" title="Nicest web related blog">scriptygoddess</a> and there's some work in progress on my <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/gallery/">gallery section</a>.</p>

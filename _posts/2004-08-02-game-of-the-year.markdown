  content: ! 'Yeah...everybody playing it ALREADY and I can''t do anything...I could
    just cry right now :(

    Not that I would have been looking forward to playing it that much, but it''s
    ... Doom, how can you not play it?

    From what I''ve heard, the script is pretty bad in some areas, an example would
    be that a door will not open if you don''t visit a certain part of the room and
    kill 2 creatures that drop down from the ceiling...well, I can''t wait to play
    it at someone else''s place before I get it .

  content: ! 'I''m playing Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic for now. I like it
    a lot but unfortunately it eats up a lot of my time. Time that I don''t have now.
    And all those figures... I''m not good with figures. So I can''t remember which
    body armor is +3 and which is +5... Blaaah!

    Anyway I''m patiently waiting for Doom since I''m a big-big fan of 1st person
    shooters. And I''m sure I''ll like it and finish it in about, well, 3 nights.
    At least that''s how long Half Life lasted back then... :-)

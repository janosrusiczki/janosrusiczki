  content: ! 'Well, I know the feeling because we''re wasting the same 3000 minutes
    from RDS because we don''t know anybody with that kind of number. Ah well, since
    we don''t really have an alternative and it''s not that bad...

    Internet traffic sincerely sucks at RDS, because at Astral for 29 bucks you get
    unlimited traffic, traffic between Astral users is free of charge, after downloading
    500MB a day your speed is reduced to some 10KB/sec. In this case, Astral is far
    better, the only advantage over at RDS is that you get LinkMania, Linux.ro and
    other sites that don''t count the traffic and stuff :)

  content: ! 'Ugh! I didn''t know about the speed drop at Astral. Even if that sucks
    I would still consider switching but there is really not much chance for Astral
    here in Baia Mare. For the moment I / we''re pretty happy that we''ve got RDS
    because before they took over I was paying $45 for 64 kbps with unlimited traffic
    at the local cable company. And that was A LOT.

<p>It's time to do some low profile text based browsing for a few days. Well not really text based but no big Internet downloads for J&aacute;nos for a while because he's been a bad boy lately. A bad, bad, bad downloader boy...<br />
Why? Well, let's do some simple <a href="http://www.rdsnet.ro">RDS</a> mathematics here. For 29 bucks you get 12 gigs of traffic each month. And yeah, 300 minutes for your calls in the Romtelecom network and 3000 minutes for your calls in the RDSTel network which I'm just wasting every month, since I know a total of 3 RDSTel numbers and they're not people I call that often. That's not too bad but if I look at my traffic monitor it says 6.5 GB. And the date says October the 13th. Whoops! A simple calculation will show that when you have 12 gigs of traffic per month you can do about 400 megs per day. 13 * 400 is 5200 megs and that means I'm ahead with more 1 gig and I have to wait about 2 or 3 days for my cable modem to cool down by downloading the 3 CDs of the latest version of Mandrake Linux from the <a href="http://www.linux.ro">linux.ro</a> FTP because traffic with linux.ro and a few other sites under the RDS umbrella (of which the other notable one is <a href="http://www.linkmania.ro">Linkmania</a> gaming site) do not add up.<br />
Fortunately time will pass quick as this weekend I'll be partying like mad at the <a href="http://www.tmbase.ro/tmbase1/index_en.htm">TMBase festival</a>. Yay!</p>

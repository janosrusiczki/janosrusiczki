<p>... with the WordPress installation.</p>
<p>I moved everything to the root of the site yesterday (good bye <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/old-index.html">blank index page</a>), created redirects for every old post, renamed old folders and checked if redirects work. The old assets (images and files) are still where they used to be, so there shouldn't be any broken links. A few moments after the redirects became active I already received a spam comment so it was time to activate <a href="http://akismet.com/">Akismet</a>. It was then followed today by some other essential plug-ins like the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/">Google XML Sitemap generator</a> and the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-tools/">Twitter Tools plug-in</a>, which I'm still waiting to see in action. But for the moment everything seems to be working fine.</p>
<p>More plug-ins to come (any recommendations?) and I have to fix the header logo but I can't get hold of my <a href="http://www.adnan.ro">casual designer</a>...</p>

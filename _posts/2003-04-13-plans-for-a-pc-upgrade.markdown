<p>Well, I'm planning to turbo up my PC a little since I last upgraded my processor and mainboard back in the spring of 2001. I plan to get an AMD 2.2+ processor with the matching mainboard (I think I will choose the Epox 8RDA+) and "lots" of memory meaning 512 MB of RAM. I'm curious how long will this configuration stand... I'm amazed about the fact that what I have now still works OK. I can't say my computer is zippy. Especially not with Windows XP. But it works well. And I can't really complain much... Except when talking about games.<br />
Well. Time to put away some money for the upgrade. Find buyers for the old wares. And the rest of the procedures associated with an upgrade process.<br />

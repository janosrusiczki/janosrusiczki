<p>My computer's performance lately strongly reminds me of the first generation Pentium days when viewing more than one web page at once was something that closely resembled a kamikaze mission. Actually if I give it a second thought it wasn't really the processor's fault (I'd rather blame the limited memory) and truth to be told my Windows installation dates back to sometime last year and I sure installed a lot of crap in the meantime but still, I must say it: I just can't wait for that Dual Core upgrade!</p>

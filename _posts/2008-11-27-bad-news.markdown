I just received some bad news from home: Bodri, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/funny_dog.php">the one</a> who's been driving traffic to this site from the Google image search results for "funny dog", long before <a href="http://www.icanhascheezburger.com/">lolcats</a> and <a href="http://www.ihasahotdog.com">loldogs</a> became the craze passed away. Although he was kept on a leash as a guard dog he was an extremely active and fun creature, always ready to show some love, even if I have moved from home long ago. And it's very strange because just Sunday night when I helped my father move some things around the house, he was running circles annoying us... Well, may he chase the chickens (his favorite activity) in a happier place.

<p>I know this is at least 3 days old (that's antiquity in Internet time), and I even <a href="http://twitter.com/kitsched/status/1475373281">posted it to Twitter</a> yesterday, but I still find it funny and I wanted to post it before it melts away. Image grabbed from <a href="http://www.jurnalul.ro/">Jurnalul National</a>'s <a href="http://www.jurnalul.ro/webcam/arieseni-62.html">Arieseni webcam</a> (if it isn't obvious).</p>

  content: ! 'Your screenshot occupies way too much space on the desktop, but with
    the right theme and tunning Firefox is the neatest thing.

    Besides interface, take your time and choose the extensions that will suite your
    browsing needs.

Boys and girls. If you really want to enjoy browsing again without worring about how much spyware and viruses will you get as an unwelcomed gift after a browsing session with our belowed Internet Explorer do yourself a favour and get a real browser (instead of getting antispyware and antiviruses).<br />
You do have choices, you know.<br />
My choice, <a href="http://www.mozilla.com">Mozilla's</a> name sounds too geeky according to <a href="http://www.rola.ro/lmarin/">some</a> and it's true it's a bit bloated for a dial-up download although it contains much more that just a browser, but you can't have any objection against it's smaller brother, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">Firefox</a>. It's got a cool name (as it seems that this matters to some, ehem), it's a small download (4,7 megabytes currently), it has superb functionality, it looks great and it's the coolest thing since sliced bread. Honest!<br />
And that's about all the baptism I'll post for a while, but I really wanted to post this.</p>

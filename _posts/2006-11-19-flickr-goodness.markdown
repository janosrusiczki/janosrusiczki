Just a quick note: I've uploaded a bunch of photos taken <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/archives/date-taken/2006/11/18/">yesterday</a> and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/archives/date-taken/2006/11/19/">today</a> to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/">my Flickr page</a>. Check them out. It's been an exhausting day and for the moment I'm too tired to write anything else. I'll be back with the story soon. But don't hold your breath.</p>

<blockquote><i>Mary's got the same size hands<br />
As Marilyn Monroe<br />
She put her fingers in the imprints<br />
At Manns Chinese Theater Show<br />
She coulda been a movie star<br />
Never got the chance to go that far<br />
Her life was stole<br />
Now we'll never know</i></p></blockquote>
<p><i>Kelly Rowland - Stole</i><br />
It's funny that I like some R&B songs so much while I hate much of the rest of the genre...</p>

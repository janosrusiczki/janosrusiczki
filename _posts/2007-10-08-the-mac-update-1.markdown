    IUseThis is fine (here is <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/user/kitone" rel="nofollow">my
    profile</a>, btw), but for a larger repository try the <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/macosx/"
    rel="nofollow"> VersionTracker</a>.

    Also, you can try using the QT Player with unsupported video files by installing
    <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/28842" rel="nofollow">Flip4Mac</a>.

    I know about VersionTracker but IUseThis has it''s own "social" beauty and I''m
    a sucker for these things. Otherwise thanks for the handy tips Kit, actually you
    were one of those I thought about when I wrote that several people will be proud
    of me in the previous post... :)

<p>Hopefully this will be the first of a series written by a recent switcher... :)</p>
<p>I've installed the Perian extension for movies right after I reinstalled OSX but the sound was desynchronized in several movies so I got rid of it pretty fast and installed good ol' <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a> instead. In case of problems there's one more alternative on the list, <a href="http://www.mplayerhq.hu/">MPlayer</a>, but for the moment VLC works flawlessly so there's no reason for another change. I'm missing the sweet QT Player interface, but oh well.</p>
<p><a href="http://pax.mioritics.ro/">Alex</a> pointed me to an awesome site: <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/">iusethis</a> which let's you specify the applications you use and shows you "neighbors" which are users with the same preferences as yours (&agrave; la <a href="http://www.last.fm">last.fm</a>). You can take a peek and see what else they're using but there's also a most used applications section which comes in extremely handy for a newborn Mac user. Like <a href="http://osx.iusethis.com/user/kitsched">me</a>.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>

<p>My first pseudo-lomo experiment. I liked this photo since the moment I shot it sometime in 2005 but somehow something was missing. Now I feel that I replaced that missing something in Photoshop. I know it's a cheap and overused effect but I still love how the image turned out. And I promise I won't abuse it...</p>

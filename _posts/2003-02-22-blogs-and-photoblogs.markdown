<p>I received a mail from <a href="http://www.triggerfinger.ro/lmarin/" title="He gave up having his personal space on the Web. Wanker! :-)">a friend</a> telling me that '<a href="http://www.iamgeneric.com/">I Am Generic</a>' is the best weblog of them all.<br />
Why??? I don't get it!<br />
I guess it's because of the simplicity. Minimalism. Or is it about the pictures?<br />
I remembered, and took another look at the <a href="http://www.fairvue.com/?feature=awards2003" title="The third annual Weblog awards">Bloggies</a> because I thought the awards were given away. Not until March 9th it seems. Anyway from there I got on the 2003 <a href="http://www.photojunkie.org/photobloggies/" title="These are even better than the Bloggies!">Photobloggies</a> page. I checked out a few links. And I wished I had broadband or at least some permanent connection not this f*@#ing dial-up which costs a fortune if you connect during daytime.</p>

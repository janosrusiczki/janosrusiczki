<p>Wow. Nice! It looks like messages arrive in my <a href="http://mail.rdslink.ro">RDSLink email</a> account with an average delay of 4 hours. That's cool. Really cool. That's the definitive sign of a truly proffesional ISP. As a hint: they'd better hire some proffesionals to do server administration or call them back from that extended Easter holiday break.</p>

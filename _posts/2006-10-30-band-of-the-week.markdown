<p>Ladies and gentlemen: <a href="http://www.shinytoyguns.com">Shiny Toy Guns</a>. I first heard "<a href="http://www.shinytoyguns.com/wordpress/?p=27">Don't Cry Out</a>" in a snowboard video a while ago but without knowing what I'm listening to. So, yesterday when Ioana was browsing MySpace (but sssh!, don't tell anyone, because MySpace is officially gay) and the tune started playing in one snowboarder's profile I raised my head and said: "Hey, what's that? I like it!" And, as it happens in these cases a few minutes later the song was sitting comfortably in Winamp ready to be played millions of times... :)<br />
PS. And of course they reminded me almost instantly of <a href="http://www.froufrou.net/">Frou Frou</a> so now <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Details_%28album%29">Details</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/We_Are_Pilots_%28v2%29">We Are Pilots</a> are happily shuffled around.</p>

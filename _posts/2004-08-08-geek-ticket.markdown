It belongs to me and no it's not Photoshopped. I myself bought it, put it in my pocket, rode the bus, and when I came into the appartment I emptied my pockets as usual. When I saw the number on it my jaw dropped. I guess the chances weren't so high to get a ticket which such a serial number. So I consider myself lucky, and I safely tucked it away under the keyboard.<br />
I'll frame it later on. OK, maybe that's a little too much, but I'll surely keep it.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/ps2-network-adapter.gif" width="160" height="144" alt="PlayStation2 Network Adapter" class="postimage" /> Anyone got one for sale? I can't find any (and I've looked and searched hard) and "experts" told me they're nearly impossible to get by now. I still have some hope though. My PS2 has been laying uselessly for more than half a year now because of the effed up optical unit... But now that <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/ps2/action/godofwar2/index.html">God of War 2</a> is out I'm having the itchy fingers symptom all over again. A network adapter would come in handy as it also provides an IDE interface so I could play backed up games from any IDE hard drive... Please help a casual gamer in need.<br />

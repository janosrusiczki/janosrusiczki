I wish to all who read this message the warmest and merriest Christmas of them all. Have a nice Holiday Season friends...

<b>UPDATE:</b> Oh yeah, one of my favorite Christmas songs is The Pogues's <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogstuff/The_Pogues_and_Kirsty_MacColl-Fairytale_of_New_York.mp3" title="Ehem...">Fairytale Of New York</a> performed with Kirsty MacColl (who unfortunately passed away in December 2000, RIP)... Alongside Dream Theather's <i>Falling Into Infinity</i> album and a bunch of others I can't remember now. Let me finish by quoting part of the Pogues song's <a href="http://www.kirstymaccoll.com/lyrics/lyrics/fairy.htm" title="Full lyrics">lyrics</a>:

<blockquote> You scum bag

You maggot

You cheap lousy faggot

Happy Christmas your arse

I pray God

It's our last</p></blockquote>
Yep, it's a little raw! But still, Merry Christmas everyone!

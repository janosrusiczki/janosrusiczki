<p>Oh and talking about professionalism... Watching the videos below (made for one of Baia Mare's mayor candidates) will make you hurt. I guarantee it.</p>

<p>The spots were created by an advertising agency from Cluj. I'm sorry but I refuse to link reta... Uhm, I mean, professionals.</p>
<p>I'm sure as hell not going to vote as I'm way too fed up with these leeches. It is my belief that it doesn't matter who gets in the chair, he'll be just as corrupt as the current one, he'll steal just as much and it'll be all the same for the average citizen. So, thanks but no thanks.</p>

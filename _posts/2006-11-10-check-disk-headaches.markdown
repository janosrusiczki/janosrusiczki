    I was working away on a project, shut down, had some coffee. Came back and my
    pc''s gone mental?! Damn windows.

    Aaaanyways trying out the method posted above, but for some reason windows isn''t
    liking Safe Mode with command prompt. Might just leave the startup chkdsk to do
    its thing.

    Cheers for the info above, probably be throwing stuff at it right now if I hadn''t
    found this.

    -But can I ask how long to run chkdsk?Your guy said it''s several minutes to leave
    chkdsk running and dont mention the message "Inserting an index entry into index

    -My chkdsk has run for 30''.But still that message.Should I interrupt it? OR continue

    I tried to quickly make my computer hibernate but it wouldnt let me. So I saved
    all my work and turned the computer off. Then I unplugged everything from the
    UPS and turned that off too. After a while, I plugged everything back in and turned
    it on and now chkdsk is just going and going... I don''t even know what drive
    its working on. I have 2 250GB drives, an 80GB and a firewire external 500GB...
    the firewire one is my backup but I haven''t backed up a lot of my newest stuff...
    I really hope letting this run works.

    Thanks for your info. It''s helping me stay relaxed.

  content: ! 'Mysterious!  I had a failure of my OS from doing the sp3 upgrade.  I
    put my HD in as a slave and bought another.  I loaded  XP from my original disk
    (the ancient version, before sp1) and was able to read all the files on my old
    drive.  I then laboriously updated and patched my new drive and OS with all the
    MS KB''s and bells and whistles.  Thinking I might be able to restore the old
    HD to an operating OS, I didn''t transfer any files nor format it.  I was also
    able to link to it through USB.  I shared some of the important files so that
    I could transfer them to my wirelessly networked laptop, and I was able to do
    that.

    Then there was another update for XP -- and the power company unceremoniously
    cut my power for just long enough to shut down my desktop.  When I rebooted, my
    old hd was unreadable and a warning appeared that it was corrupted.  I decided
    that I might be able to read it if I reinstalled it as a slave.  And when I did
    that, I experienced exactly the same scenarios that all of you have, except that
    my message was  "...$0 in file 18301..."  I got past that and am still waiting
    for chkdsk to finish; now, it''s replacing invalid security ids in sequencing
    file numbers.

    I have tremendous hopes after reading your forum, but it remains to be seen why
    we all had sudden failures like this after seemingly normal operation.  Was it
    due to a particular Windows "Update"?

  content: ! 'Thanks for the encouragement and hopes; here is an update:

    Well..., I made sure my version of XP included SP2 and all updates, but those
    were in place when the problem occurred.  Like others, the problem disc is 200gb,
    Western Digital, and formatted as NTFS from the beginning.  It was performing
    well as a slave and through the USB 2 port until two things happened:

    1.)  I changed a number of directories to "Shared" status so I could begin to
    pull off files to my laptop (and did so successfully -- thank God!); and

    2.)  the power company linesmen interrupted the powere momentarily (about two
    seconds), which shut the desktop pc down -- the one that had the subject HD attached
    to its USB port.

    I was already having a problem writing to this disk from the network -- no warning
    message, no errors noted, just a long write time when the power went down.  But
    I have occasional network "lapses," so I don''t know if the drive was in the process
    of recording at the time.

    After reading all the comments above, I reattached the drive (which couldn''t
    be read at all through the USB port) to the IDE cable as a slave and booted the
    desktop.  After several hours of CHKDSK, I was able to see the disk according
    to its labeled name, the one I gave it when it was formatted, and about ten files,
    most of which seemed to be system files and one picture -- the one I use for the
    logon user icon.  Nothing more; about 30k worth of files, but the disk usage shows
    about 140mb -- 2/3rds -- used.  I have not written anything to this disk and have
    not even tried opening any of the files, in the event they might record something
    to the disc.

    I''ve since installed SP3 and thought I might reboot and retry CHKDSK from "Safe
    Mode."  I really haven''t much to lose at this point, unless all my tax information,
    my unpublished writings, and all my genealogy notes and Excel and Access databases
    can be recovered.  I did have backups, but I had been busy updating many of them
    with new information and editing changes that didn''t get backed up.

    I thought I might thow that to the forum to see what someone might say.

    I''m still conjecturing that some recent (or past) MS update might be at the bottom
    of this.  How many of the culprit discs were over 137Gb and NTFS formatted?

    to boot Windows but then gave me message "One of your discs needs to be checked
    for consistency."  I went ahead and it went through a 3 stage process -

    1) Verifying files - it said complete

    2) Verifying indexes - It corrected an error in Index $SII for file 9

    3) Verifying security descriptors - On this last check after a while it started
    multiple messages of the type " Inserting index entry xxxx with ID yyyy into Index
    $zzz of file 9."  There were hundreds of these messages and it just kept going.  Eventually
    I stopped it with the OFF button and then tried to reboot, but the same thing
    happened.  Please help somebody.  Should I let it just carry on running or am
    I likely to be losing my hard drive data as it does this check? Thanks,  Dave

  content: ! "OK - I waited for a year after experiencing the exact same problem as
    most of you. At that time, I let chkdsk continue even though it worked for over
    four hours doing strange things with the 180gb on my 250gb NTFS formatted OS drive.
    The cause was a stupid mistake on my part -- no, THREE stupid mistakes! I over-confidently
    tried to upgrade my XP-SP2 to SP3 before it was fully proven, and I could not
    reboot, not even into Safe Mode. Althouth the OS was crapped, all my valuable
    files and reports were intact and could have been backed up using my laptop and
    a USB external drive (no. 2 mistake). I used an old 80gb drive, wiped clean, and
    loaded my old XP onto it; then plugged my problem drive in as secondary, hoping
    to remove the OS so I could start (no. 3 mistake). My version of XP was before
    SP2 so it couldn't recognize my larger 250gb drive -- so it ran chkdsk.\r\nLast
    week, I bit the bullet and plugged the problem disk in as secondary, once again,
    but with XP-SP3 fully installed and well tested. I booted into Safe Mode with
    command line and ran chkdsk /f.  After about three hours I was able to pull my
    files out of about 500 chkdsk files which contained familiar sub-directories and
    myriad isolated files.  So far, I've only found a few incomplete picture files,
    but my videos, reports, and research files appear to be saved.\r\nI owe the success
    of this operation to everyone of you who walked onto this battlefield and especially
    Janos, who resolutely kept this forum intact and available. I also admonish Microsoft
    for failing us by not offering much advice at all, no wisdom, no easily available
    XP install disk with all updates and no cautions about what might happen in such
    a case.\r\nThank you all!"

  content: ! "What a find!! I consider myself very fortunate to have found this forum,
    albeit through the screen of my wife’s laptop. The story goes a lot like this.\r\n\r\nMy
    machine was busy viscously throwing line after line of script toward the ceiling!
    Yes, yes the worrisome “Inserting an index entry into index $0 of file 25”. I’ve
    never seen so much inserting on a computer screen …………. ahem ….. file 25 can really
    take it …… whew ……. ok, pretty lame …… but I’m leaving it there. So….I, like many
    others above me, rushed for a separate working computer to find information on
    what was happening to mine. After reading a few horror stories about losing data
    I pulled the trigger and forced a reboot. About five minutes in I started receiving
    the exclamation icon in my system tray, shouting something about a “corruption
    of the $Extend\\$Objld”….owitz. I closed it out hoping like a child that it would
    go away. It of course didn’t and like a grown up I did exactly what it told me
    to do. I scheduled a Check Disk operation and prepared to let it run its course.
    Incidentally I did not run it in safe mode.\r\n\r\nAs I watched the endless repetition
    scorch my screen, and listened to the drive do its best “nails on a chalkboard”
    impression I stumbled across Janos blog. I see it has brought a semblance of calm
    to readers since November of 06. I am grateful to all those who have contributed
    information, and sympathize with those who have lost some! I was lucky. I am writing
    this from my machine which has been spit from CHKDSK seemingly unharmed after
    2 ½ hours of ……… well ….. it wasn’t that bad. I have everything backed up on an
    external WD 300Gig. My internal is also a WD 300Gig with 50 partitioned for XP
    SP3. It was the 250Gig internal partition that needed the repair.\r\n\r\nI do
    have however, additional information for future reference. I was setting folder
    permissions for the entire f:\\ drive (the 250Gig internal partition) when the
    power blipped from a wicked storm and shut down the machine. I am 99.7% sure,
    that is what caused my particular problem. Thank you Janos for keeping the thread
    alive."

  content: ! "This is an excellent site!\r\nHaving the same repeated chkdsk message
    on one of our servers with an external SCSI drive array.\r\nIn this case, the
    cause was the server being powered off for electrical testing, then started without
    first starting the array (more haste, less speed. . .).\r\nThe HP smartarray BIOS
    then insisted on disabling the array on subsequent restarts \"just in case\".
    Had to press F2 at SCSI BIOS stage to tell it to go ahead and use the array. After
    that, Windows chkdsk kicked in, with the familiar repeating index message. Not
    realising that it wasn't just stuck in a recurring loop, I powered-off after half
    an hour then cancelled the chkdsk the next time. Result: hundreds of corrupted
    files or folders on startup!\r\nNow doing another chkdsk /r /f and this time letting
    it finish. . .\r\nMany thanks to Janos for such a useful and supportive blog.
    Shame on MS for keeping quiet about this issue!"

  content: ! "I found this answer re the disc consistency notice on another website.
    I've no idea if it's valid:\r\n\r\nThis happens because during the shutdown process,
    the contents of the virtual cache are written to the destination device. \r\nIf
    device is an Integrated Drive Electronics (IDE) hard disk, data may be written
    to the hard disk's onboard cache but not to the disk itself. When this occurs,
    the data is lost from the cache when the computer turns off.\r\n\r\nTo prevent
    it,\r\n\r\n1. Disable Advanced Power Management (APM) in the computer's basic
    input/output system (BIOS)\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\n1.Start Registry Editor ( type regedit
    in Run).\r\n\r\n2.Locate and click the following key in the registry:\r\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Curr
    entVersion\r\n\r\n3.On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD Value.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.Type

    Decimal\r\n\r\n7.In the Value data box, type 2000, and then click OK.\r\n\r\n8.Quit
    Registry Editor.\r\n\r\n\r\nShut down and restart the computer. Permit Windows
    to finish running ScanDisk and wait for the Windows desktop to appear. Then, shut
    down and restart the computer again.\r\n\r\nThis should solve your problem."

<p>"Inserting an index entry into index $0 of file 25" - the message I feared for a week...</p>
<p>I don't know what happened but my storage drive (a 400 Gig Western Digital formatted as NTFS) attached via USB came up one day last week as "Local Disk" instead of "Titan" as I so aptly labeled it. Capacity and free space became 0 and it was dragging down my computer's overall speed big time. Somehow, with lots of patience I managed to schedule a Check Disk operation at startup and after a reboot and some preliminary stages the message I mentioned earlier appeared. And it appeared. And appeared. At least a few hundred times. And I could hear the drive crunching away happily. After a while I got bored and reset the computer. And when it booted I skipped the check. The good news was that I could see and read the contents of the drive from Windows but the bad news was I couldn't write or delete anything to or from it. The OS was complaining about permission issues.</p>
<p>Yesterday night I was really chilled so I thought hey, let's give it another shot. Searching the Microsoft support web site was about as helpful as a pat on the back but fortunately I found <a href="http://www.techspot.com/vb/all/windows/t-49454-Chkdsk-problems-after-Windows-reinstall--Deleting-Orphan-Files.html">a forum topic</a> started by a guy that seemed to have approximately the same problem as I did. At least the error message was the same. So I read through his experience and fortunately he posted a message after he managed to fix the issue (something many of us forget to do) and so I decided to reboot and let chkdsk complete. Better yet, I rebooted in safe mode, opened a command prompt window and run "chkdsk /f L:". I minimized the window because XP's screen refresh in safe mode is about as fast as on a 286. And there I was after a few minutes with my drive fully fixed.</p>
<p>So, what did we learn today kids? Let Check Disk do it's job, even if it seems to take forever and even if it looks like it entered an endless loop. Except when it completely brakes your drive...</p>

<p>You can see so much stupidity on IRC. But sometimes you can see fun things too:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&lt;wu-nix&gt; 666 + 1337 = 2003 :) evil l33t year</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Also saw <a href="http://www2.photosig.com/viewphoto.php?id=481822" title="A wonderful photo of a butterly.">this link</a> on IRC. It should only smile and it would be the perfect portrait.</p>

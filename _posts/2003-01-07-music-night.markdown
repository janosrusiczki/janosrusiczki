<p>Well to forget my misery I had a "music night" again. Downloaded and listened stuff I like a lot nowadays, namely breakbeat. Tune of the night was / is definetly the Plump DJs remix of Brothers Love Dubs' <i>Mighty Ming</i> which is mindblowing to say the least. Found out on <a href="http://www.discogs.com" title="Another great resource for electronica heads...">discogs.com</a> that these dub loving brothers are actually Steve Anderson and good ol' Dave Seaman.<br />
I had a recommendation from <a href="http://adt.groove.ro" title="The Dropbox">Mr. Adapt</a> to check out Waveform & Crash. Well I checked them out but I had only one tune of them, named <i>Systems Online</i>. The closest term of comparison for me was Stakka & Skynet from the drum'n'bass scene because both artists seem to be heavily influenced by sci-fi themes. At least judging from this tune. Hehe.</p>

<p>How do you know it's going to be a great week?<br />
The first thing your boss says to you just as you enter the company's door is: "you have a new LCD just unpack it and replace your faulty one". And then you discover that your LCD has no issues actually, all the problems you observed were caused by your stupid leg hitting the VGA connector on your computer.<br />
Erm, yeah, I know I shouldn't tell anyone I work with computers. Although it's a known fact that I'm no hardware wiz. On the contrary.<br />
PS. This entry's title wanted to be "Monday morning <em>monitor</em> menace" (Mmmm) but then I remembered that as opposed to Romanian, in English "monitor" is not really used to signify "display".</p>

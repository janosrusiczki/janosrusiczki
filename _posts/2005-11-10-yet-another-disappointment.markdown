<p>As I was saying in <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2005/10/31/make_flickr_work_with_your_movable_type_blog">an earlier post</a> I was thinking about getting myself a Pro account on Flickr. Heck, I was even thinking about surprising <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/vasi/">a good friend</a> who happens to be a big photo enthusiast by sponsoring him with one. The winter holidays are so close anyway... But running a check yesterday I saw those six characters that give me the shrills when I'm trying to order something online: PayPal. Combine PayPal with Romania and you get a big no-no. You know, tons of scammers, heaps of carders and the alikes... Oh well, this concludes my Pro account dreams.</p>

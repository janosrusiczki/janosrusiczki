  content: ! 'It seems to me like you should be updating your blog more frequently
    and sharing pictures of whatever... or not.  And on a side note - could you please
    take the post that was at <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/01/16/starting_mysql_at_boot_time_on_a_cobalt_raq_550.php"
    rel="nofollow">http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/01/16/starting_mysql_at_boot_time_on_a_cobalt_raq_550.php</a>
    and put it somewhere?  It''s 404ing for me.

    Thanks! :)

  content: ! 'Hey..I love the way your Flickr photos look. I am currently using the
    flash version of the Flickr badge app. Can you tell me how you built (give me
    the code) to div id="flickr_container"?

    The rest I think I can figure out.

    Many thanks.

<p>I've been having problems getting <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> to work with this blog (the 'Blog This' button in Flickr to be more precise) but I finally managed to solve the issue. This is for everybody who upgraded from an earlier version of <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a>: delete your old config file otherwise Flickr will refuse to list your blog claiming you entered a wrong username / password combination. I was already bashing my keyboard at a point and then gave up for a while but later I tried using some <a href="http://www.qoop.com/photobooks/flickr_user/">photo printing service</a>, which reported the exact error and so I started playing around with the config files... Now everything is working fine and I'm dreaming about a Pro account on Flickr... :-)</p>

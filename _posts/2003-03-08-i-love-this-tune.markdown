<blockquote><i>Got answers for everyone, endless excuses<br />
Not habit for anyone, cos I'm trying to break your click-track heart<br />
Seen a vision of perfect grace, airbrushed and lifeless<br />
All contempt and aftertaste it's like I'm waiting for the scars to heal</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Sneaker Pimps - Loretta Young Silks</p>

  content: ! 'Well, say hello to Mr. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/620/916"
    rel="nofollow">DO NOT WANT</a>. After some searching I came to the conclusion
    that LinkedIn sucks when it comes to account deletions. But it''s their loss,
    instead of having a clean site with minimal clutter they have a bunch of trash
    accounts.

  content: ! 'I discovered the same thing but now have encountered a puzzle.  I copied
    2 mini-DV tapes using my Sony DVD recorder RDR-GX330, sp mode.  One to A DVD+RW
    and the other to A DVD-R.  Changing the extensions works for both sets of VOB
    files and I can import them into either Pinnacle 9.4 or Adobe Premier but the
    files from the DVD-R only show up as about 10 seconds long and behave the same
    way when I try to use Windows media player but they play fine with Cyberlink Power
    DVD.

<p>After wasting a few precious hours wading through forums and worthless shareware sites (all promoting the same 4 or 5 applications) I finally found the easiest method to convert VOBs recorded by a DVD camera into MPGs that are recognized by Ulead's Crap, uuuhm, I mean, <a href="http://www.ulead.com/dws/runme.htm">DVD Workshop</a>. And the solution is, ladies and gentlemen: changing the damn file extensions! The funniest aspect of all this hustle is that the aforementioned Ulead app recognized and imported 4 (mini)DVDs almost instantly but it had something personal with the 5th one because I couldn't import it no matter how I tried... Oh well, I'm glad I solved the problem.</p>

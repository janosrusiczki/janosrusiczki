  content: ! 'This is a great widget!  While the original MacAdSense is simple, I
    do like the few more tidbits of stats this provides.

    The only issues I have spotted since use is with larger click numbers the text
    starts to over lap.  I would be more than happy to provide any screenshots.

    I hope to see updates!  Thanks for your work.

    On the click stats, a "." is used instead of a "," when getting into the thousands
    etc.

  content: ! 'Hi J치nos! I really like your widget. It works almost perfectly, but
    I don''t know why my monthly total is 2 cents under the real value (it shows up
    OK in MacAdSense). I like your widget better than plain ol MacAdSense because
    I really need to see those Today and Yesterday values, but I haven''t uninstalled
    MacAdSense yet because of that discrepancy in the monthly total. Know why that
    might be?

    Thanks

    Laura

  content: ! 'I just thought I would stop in to give an update to my issues I stated
    earlier in the comments.

    I solved the issue myself by editing a single line in the php code.  In the file
    MacAdsense.php I simply commented out the line:

    $result = str_replace(",", ".", $result);

    This fixed both the "," issue and larger numbers not fitting properly in the boxed
    areas.

    Thanks so much once again for creating such an awesome tool!

  content: ! 'J치nos, great work! I found your widget and it works great for me under
    10.5! I noticed one extremely small issue, which is that the version number on
    the back side of the version 0.2 widget is still listed as 0.1. Again, very minor.
    Keep up the good work!

  content: ! 'Hi !

    I used MacAdsense, and I discovered MacAdsensePlus today. It seems very cool,
    but numbers stay at zero... Nothing seems to work for me. MacAdsense works well,
    and MacAdsensePlus not.

    How can we try to understand this ?

  content: ! 'FYI, anyone having problems with this widget after Feb 27, 2008, please
    visit adsense.google.com and agree to the new terms. Once you do, load this widget
    again, typing your password on the back, and it will work again. I just tried
    this after having this widget ''fail'' for about the last month, and that fixed
    it. It also fixes the non-"Plus" one as well.

    Hope that helps someone!

  content: ! 'Hello J치nos,

    I love the MacAdsensePlus widget.  it has been working very well for me despite
    some of the Google updates to their CVS file.  I was hoping you have not given
    up on this widget.  The only issues I can see with it currently are the numbers
    for "clicks" are not showing the right numbers.

    Thanks for reading yet another comment of mine.

<p>I just released the second public version of this widget which includes a bug fix related to incorrect reporting for weeks spanning 2 months and a debug mode which is turned on by default... But let's start at the beginning, shall we?</p>
<p>First the description: MacAdSensePlus is a Dashboard widget that conveniently displays your Google AdSense earnings and click count for today, yesterday, the current and last week as well as for the current and the last month.</p>
<p>This is my first effort at writing a Dashboard widget and since I didn't want to start from scratch I set out to modify <a href="http://blog.oswaldism.de/macadsense-simple-adsense-widget-for-mac-os-x">MacAdSense</a> which was already out there, was written in PHP (yey!) but was showing too little info for my tastes. So I sat down on one gloomy weekend after Ioana's grandfather passed away and started tweaking it as needed. As of version 0.2 I still can't consider it fully ready as the it's icon for example still belongs to the original MacAdSense but I'm pushing forward as fast as I can and I'm not a graphic artist either.</p>
<p>The main thing I'm missing now are testers. Testers who can provide me with feedback. And the debug file. So I can see what's wrong and why does it display only zeros for some people. I won't start implementing new features (like the suggested currency conversion) until I'm not convinced that it grabs the basic data for everyone. Here are some stats for now: works for 3 AdSense accounts of which 2 were tested by me. Reportedly doesn't work for 2 but there might be others that downloaded it after my "post about it on every Mac forum" campaign and never bothered reporting back if it works or not. Grrr.</p>
<p>Anyway, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/macadsenseplus/releases/MacAdSensePlus.0.2.wdgt.zip">download version 0.2</a> and test it out. Requirements are Mac OS X 10.4 or later and an AdSense account that's making some money. And most importantly, remember kids, if you download it, whether it works or not feedback is <strong>essential</strong>. Use the comments Luke!</p>

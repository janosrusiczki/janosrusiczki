<p>A friend recommended me the <a title="Bathroom Habits Survey" href="http://www.bathroomsurvey.com/">Bathroom Habits Survey</a> which I had a lot of fun completing. The funniest part was reading the survey results after completing and submiting the initial form.<br />
Some golden quotes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you an inspector?</li>
<li>Have you ever urinated in the shower?</li>
<li>Have you ever tried to fart but pooped in your pants instead?</li>
</ul>
<p>And when I thought this was funny I checked out <a href="http://www.bathroomlife.com/">BathroomLife.com</a>  which sent me rolling on the floor. Just by checking the <a href="http://www.poopnames.com/">The Poop List</a>.<br />
I always enjoyed dirty humor! :-)</p>

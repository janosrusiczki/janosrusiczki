  content: ! 'If you are big on a company''s politics, one reason to not go with GoDaddy
    is their owner''s support for torture regarding the United States'' occupation
    of Iraq and POWs.

    As for their actual domain service, it is alright, I used to have 16+ domains
    registered with them but couldn''t handle the constant spam via email and ad bombardment
    on the site, so have switched to DynaDot.com, which has been fantastic.

    All the best!

<p>As my new plan of action is to get all my domains under <a href="http://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a>'s wing I started out by transferring a client's domain there and extending it by 5 years while I was at it. The good news was that the order amount was really close to $40 and as an avid viewer of <a href="http://diggnation.com">Diggnation</a> I had the 'DIGG5' coupon code which gives $10 off any order above $40. And so I added another domain to the order and applied the coupon code which brought my order back under $40...<br />
Now the important part. Out of a moment's inspiration the bonus domain I registered was clicktrackheart.com... :) Please don't ask me from which part of my brain that popped out (btw, the three words are <a href="http://www.lyricstime.com/sneaker-pimps-loretta-young-silks-lyrics.html">part of a Sneaker Pimps song's lyrics</a>) but it probably has to do with my eyes seeing the word 'click' on the page and my brain faintly registering and then associating randomly. Anyway, I installed Google Apps on it a few minutes after registering it and here I am now, giving away FREE email addresses for the real Sneaker Pimps fans. If you want one, you should know that your e-mail interface will look just like Gmail, with the exact amount of space and other features that Gmail has plus you can access it from Outlook or whatever your favorite e-mail client is... And all this for free. Just shoot me an e-mail (you can find my address in the left sidebar of my blog) and not forgetting to include the user name you want. And no, I won't read your e-mail.<br />
Oh, and if you have any feedback regarding GoDaddy, don't hesitate to share. I don't want to make a mistake by transferring all my domains to them and then discovering negative this and negative that. Until now my impressions are positive judging at least from the administration panel's responsiveness which is waaay faster than the one over at <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">Dreamhost</a>.</p>

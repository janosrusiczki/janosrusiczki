    are passionate on what you are doing. I didn''t succeed in trying Analytics because
    google stoped from registering us the mortals. I''ll wait....:(

  content: ! 'Well, you shouldn''t have bothered. Actually I post these kind of entries
    because sometimes I read my blog backwards and I like to find these milestones
    to see how things "evolved" around here.

    Sorry about Analytics. I jumped on the bandwagon right during it''s first day,
    before the Google guys realized that the service''s huge success could ruin it''s
    performance. That''s how I got my paws on the account. For a while I couldn''t
    create any new profiles (you can analyze the trafic of several sites using the
    same account - these are the profiles), now they raised the limit to 5. I''m sure
    that in a short while they''ll open signups again. Just wait patiently. And subscribe
    to <a href="http://digg.com" rel="nofollow">digg''s</a> feed or create an RSS
    alert to be among the first ones who jump on the second bandwagon. :-)

<p>Approximately at the time I did those Flickr compatibility tweaks I decided to mess up my so called "permanent links" after almost 2 years of, well, permanency. I was annoyed by the fact that my URLs ended in .php - actually they were useful this way before Movable Type implemented it's dynamic page generation because I could place PHP scripts in the templates which would be executed when the page was loaded by a visitor. But as soon as Six Apart added the feature I opted for dynamic pages because otherwise each and every of the archive pages took up it's own space on my host, and I never actually put any PHP content in them.<br />
But even after switching to dynamic pages the structure remained and my links still looked like www.rusiczki.net / blog / archives / year / month / day / something.php. So, after I took a deep breath, I decided to mess things up. I needed that deep breath because by changing my permalink structure all the inbound links to my inside pages became invalid. Plus after el grande change, all my basenames (entry tile: Hello world it's me = basename: hello_world_its_me) needed manual corrections and I haven't had the time to do them all until yesterday. And since I was working on my blog I also corrected all the internal links (posts linking other posts) so now everything should be OK and in about a half a year the 404 errors will slowly but surely dim. After the almighty Google reindexes everything, that is.<br />
Oh, I almost forgot: look out! Big Brother is watching you! A few days ago I installed Google Analytics.</p>

<p>You might remember I had a post about scamming people on eBay - it was one of the most popular ones posted to this blog, judging by the keywords people search for and then pop in here from Google. Actually, it was an anti-post, calling the scammers idiots because back then I was very pissed off about not being able to buy from <a href="http://www.ebay.com">the small e</a>, but it seems that many did not get that. I was getting e-mails and IMs from time to time, asking me to teach them scamming and then...</p>
<p>First he called while I was at work. When I saw the number I knew something is not right and I didn't answer. Then he sent me this message:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/the-scam-teacher-1.jpg" alt="SMS from the scammer #1" title="SMS from the scammer #1" width="240" height="240" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-717" /> <img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/the-scam-teacher-2.jpg" alt="SMS from the scammer #2" title="SMS from the scammer #2" width="240" height="240" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-718" /></p>
<p>An e-mail came next with basically the same content. He then called me again while I was at home. Then called the landline. Called again. And again. Ioana picked up and spoke in Romanian then I picked up the next one and spoke in Romanian. Some pseudo-English mumbling was heard from the other side of the line then click. I set the landline to silent, shut off my mobile for the night and sent him an e-mail telling him to never call me again. He tried calling a few times the next day and then he probably saw the e-mail and sent an apology reply. No calls after that.</p>
<p>I removed the post in a hurry as well as my contact details (which I put back in the meantime).</p>
<p>I don't want to be racist but do Nigerians consider this as a full time job? You know, like there's a first time investments in placing an International call to a "genius" who will enlighten them about the great schemes of scamming and then, off they go! How about you know, actual work!? Neah, easy money is much better.</p>

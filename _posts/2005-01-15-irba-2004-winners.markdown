    to IRBA 04. Plus that the number of Romanian bloggers will be way higher than
    the one from today.

  content: ! 'It wasn''t related to *that*.

    I imagined that if I leave a notice up for 3 days everyone would get to see it.
    It seems that nobody did ;-)

    I''m taking my new found time to work on my other projects. The site was getting
    stale and took up more and more of my time. I''ll be back, at one point or another,
    with something else. I had already said that the blog format is unsuitable for
    the things I want to write about.

<p>No, I didn't grab anything, not even a third prize. Not that I was nominated in that many categories, but I guess that this is the prize for my laziness to write entries and even to urge people to vote for me. :-)<br />
For those interested there's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/cpaul/iblog/C1156848003/E1664537946/index.html">a really short sum up of the winners</a> on <a href="http://www.kitblog.com">Cristian Paul's blog</a>. Unfortunately I can't link to the official results, and there will probably be no IRBA 2005. And that's because <a href="http://www.individualism.ro">Gabriel</a> suddenly decided to take his blog offline. All the links give nice 404s. I wonder, could it be related to <a href="http://www.troniu.dk/index.php?c=1536">this</a>?<br />
Anyway, next year get ready for k!RBA. Now guess what that 'k!' stands for. Or well, maybe not. Hehe.</p>

<p>I can't find my brand new 4 gig SanDisk flash drive and I'm desperately searching for it for a few days now. I'm quite upset because I don't usually loose stuff but it looks like this time I did it. Oh well... I just wish there was a Google Desktop Life Edition, or something.<br />
<b>Update (1 day later):</b> Found it in the car! Hooray!</p>

<p><img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/beer_20_pack.jpg" width="200" height="150" border="0" alt="Will it be enough?" class="postimage" /> That last <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2002/12/31/the_new_years_eve_party">party rant</a> begins to lose sense when I take a peek at that 20 pack I have waiting for me on the hallway. It really gives me courage for the two nights ahead. Two and a half hours and I'm gone.<br />
Oh. Forgot to mention that it's going to be the same old sausage party as usual. Like 10 guys and 4 girls. Great.<br />
But I'm still optimist.<br />
Again, looking at that beer pack makes me even a bigger optimist!</p>

<p>Well, here I am. Blogging.</p>
<p>Starting off the I-REALLY-DONT-KNOW-TH time.</p>
<p>I hope this will be a more persistent blogging experience since my previous ones ended quite abruptly. Anyway <a href="http://www.geocities.com/rusiczkij/weblog/blogger.html" title="my 2001-ish blog">my last blog</a> ended too fast because my Internet connection was suddenly cut. I mean I had some troubles because my phone line by that time was an antique one, meaning that my family's phone line was <i>locked</i> together with one of a neighbour's, and all the dial-up costs showed up on his bill.</p>
<p>Pretty funny actually. From my point of view of course... And so to avoid more trouble I couldn't connect any more from home and I just can't blog from Internet caf&eacute;s.</p>
<p>Too bad. Because re-reading that blog brings up nice memories. And I actually love writing journals because of this. Because they help dig up things that you'd think you've forgotten a long long time ago. Actually all is there. Locked safely. And a journal makes it all pop out of the haze. And it's nice. I guess I love living on memories...</p>
<p>Well, enough intro. Here I am. Posting again...</p>

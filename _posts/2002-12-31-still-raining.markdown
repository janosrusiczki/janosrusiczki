<p>Since I wrote that entry entitled '<a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2002/12/28/its_raining">It's raining</a>' it's been raining constantly. And I wonder how it would looked like if all this rain was snow? I think we would be in BIG TROUBLE. Anyway I understood that snow and even snow showers are close now. And I'm so excited!</p>

    Is there anything that can be done about your dad''s drinking problem though?

    Best of luck

  content: ! 'Thanks Andreea.

    In a normal world there would have been. But in small town in Northern Romania
    there isn''t much to do.

    I mean, there were times when he recognized he''s got an issue and went into therapy,
    but it never lasted long afterwards. It was just like in this case, a ticking
    time bomb. However lately (10 - 15 years at least) "nu se pune problema" as this
    is his only hobby: drinking himself to the point where he''s unable to get off
    the bed, and when it wears off, drinking some more.

    The only thing I wonder about is why did my Mum stay with such a wreck?

    I could go on and on about this, but there''s no use. Bottom line is, you can
    get therapy if you want to. But he doesn''t want to, he''s "proud" of himself
    as he is and for the moment I''m sort of ignoring him and am trying to concentrate
    on getting my Mum back on her feet.

<p>As <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2009/01/26/a_bitter_update">predicted</a> my father cracked (read: started drinking heavily) so yesterday evening I had to move my mother to my grandfather to make sure she's getting the minimal care she needs. That's a warm place to rest, food and medication - 3 things my "dear" father failed to provide after less than a week of soberness. All this after the horrific scene he made when wanted to place my mother at my grandfather's place right after we took her out of the hospital. However for the moment I have no next step planned.</p>
<p>How's this for a drama? Not too bad, eh? Actually it's bad, really bad and I'm so sick of the whole situation I can't even begin to explain... :(</p>

<p>I missed the first hour or so because despite <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2008/06/09/keynote_frenzy_ahead">my morning promise</a> I went to a bar to watch that total EPIC FAIL of a match between Romania and France. Boooring. But it seems I haven't lost anything of the keynote. It was mostly iPhone application demos and MobileMe which is $99 for a year. No thanks!<br />
Only after I got home Steve broke the news everyone was waiting for. And the conclusion is... I'm starting to want one. A <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/">3G iPhone</a> that is. $199 globally? That's awfully nice of them! But I think in Romania it'll still sell at around $450... I'll believe the 200 bucks when I'll see it.<br />
I'll wait for Google Maps to include Romania first! Now with the integrated GPS it makes even more sense. Come on Google!<br />
<strong>Update:</strong> Actually <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/">MobileMe</a> doesn't <a href="http://www.apple.com/mobileme/guidedtour/">look</a> that bad. I'll have a trial, please. As soon as it'll be available.</p>

<p>My appologies to those who tried to comment since <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2006/04/16/im_so_back">my grande return</a> but it looks like I forgot to set some permissions right. I was a bit suspicious seeing that nothing is coming in but I was not suspicious enough to do a simple check.<br />
Anyway, everything should be working now.<br />
Thanks to the one who notified me.</p>

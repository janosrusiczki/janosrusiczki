<p>The <em>professionals</em> that provide us Internet at work, namely <a href="http://www.ipn.ro/">IPN</a>, have some lame filters installed which went rogue and now deny access to random sites. My biggest gripe for the moment is the blockage of <a href="http://tinyurl.com">tinyurl.com</a> which means <a href="http://twitter.com">twittering</a> in the short breaks I have becomes rapidly frustrating as no links can be accessed. And no, they're not productivy boosting filters, as for a while Mozilla's download site was blocked too. That meant Firefox updates were performed by bringing the browser's setup file on a USB stick from home. Or transferring it via <a href="http://box.net">box.net</a>. And that's how I know the filters are out of control, because obviously we called them about this issue and they said they're aware of it but have no idea what to do. Professionals, as I said.</p>
<p><strong>Update!</strong> Found <a href="http://www.untinyurl.com/">a solution</a>.</p>

<p>I've just deleted the first 4 spam comments of my blog. Part of me is happy: I've been noticed and it looks like my weblog "counts" for someone out there, or at least for Google. But the rest of me, the bigger part, is sad: it's more than enough to deal with Internet trash in my email... I've banned one IP, but I don't think it counts too much as there are thousands of proxies out there.<br />
The strange part is that earlier today I read an interesting post on <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/archive/2004/01/28/solvingCommentSpam">solving comment spam</a> in <a href="http://simon.incutio.com/">Simon Willison's Weblog</a> and I was thinking: phew, I'm glad this kind of crap didn't happen to me yet. Well... It did now.<br />
<b>UPDATE:</b> I downloaded and installed Jay Allen's <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/comment_spam/" title="MT-Blacklist/Comment Spam Clearinghouse">MT-Blacklist</a> plugin just so I won't have nightmares with comment spam clogging my beloved weblog. Also updated <a href="http://www.movabletype.org">Movable Type</a> to the latest version as of this writing which is 2.661.</p>

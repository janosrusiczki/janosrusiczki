I didn't know they did. I just thought it's forward looking house music that happens to sound extremely groovy.</p>
<p>I first found out about Akufen last year when I read about him in somekind of a top ten and then downloaded 'Deck The House' the same night. It played for a while in my MP3 player back then and I liked the song a lot but somehow I forgot about it later. But about a month ago I put my hands on the whole album and it's a great piece of music that got stuck in my earphones for a few weeks now.</p>
<p>If anybody would ask me now how today's, or better yet, tommorow's house should sound, I'd say: Akufen like. Checking some reviews on the Internet today, I saw that for <a href="http://pitchforkmedia.com/record-reviews/a/akufen/my-way.shtml">some</a> the style was already old and expired back in 2002, but for stupid me it still sounds extremely fresh and groundbreaking.</p>
<p>By the way, Akufen is Marc Leclair from Montreal, Canada and his music can be best described as... Hell, I'm just going to quote <a href="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=13">this review</a> from <a href="http://www.stylusmagazine.com/">Stylus Magazine</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Akufen&rsquo;s gimmick (if you will allow me to be reductive for a moment) is his use of pick-a-mix radio samples to create melodies. Akufen molds sub-second fragments of pop songs, people talking, and other auditory ephemera into burbling melody lines.</p></blockquote>
<p>And let me tell you that as chaotic as this might sound it turns out great for him! Oh, and if you have a credit card at hand you can create a trial account at <a href="http://www.emusic.com">Emusic</a>, guilt freely <a href="http://www.emusic.com/album/10667/10667089.html">download the whole album</a> and then still have a bunch of trial credits to check out some of the other great indie stuff of which Emusic is chock full of...</p>

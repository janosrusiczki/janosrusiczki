<p>I'm sitting in front of my computer, catching up with <a href="http://blog.whois.hu/index.php">one</a> favourite blog while listening to the latest and greatest <a href="http://www.thinnerism.com" title="The greatest netlabel PERIOD">Thinner</a> release. Did I ever mentioned that I purely love the music that comes out on Thinner? Oh yes, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2003/04/09/ode_to_thinner" title="Kitsched - Ode to Thinner">I did</a>.<br />
Today's accomplishments? Well, 18 rounds of riding down my favourite mountain. And then laying lazily in bed watching Sliders and Startgate while munching popcorn.<br />
What? It's Saturday night? Well, I don't regret one bit that I'm not going out tonight. I'm almost paralized anyway. A little too much effort over my usual standards and besides I haven't slept after coming home, as I usually do, because I couldn't. Reason? Pepsi Lemon. Lots of Pepsi Lemon.<br />
But anyway, this was one great day!</p>

<p>[ Sun 02/02/2003 07:09 PM ] Delayed due to customs inspection // Event localization : BUCHAREST<br />
Oh no. Not again. My digital camera got stuck at the fucking Romanian customs for a week...<br />
I'll check this as mad today. Because if yesterday night it was in Bucharest and it's OK with the customs it should arrive today! But if there will be another entry about the customs it'll be clear: another week. Another custom fees... I just hope not!</p>

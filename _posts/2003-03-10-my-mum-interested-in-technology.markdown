<p>Tonight my mother was in my room to do some work. Because she said she couldn't concentrate out in the kitchen where father was watching Big Brother... Anyway. I helped her to calculate some calories (as she's a nurse at a kindergarten). And instead of the usual calculator I've used the Palm to do the arithmetics. And then she used the Palm to do the arithmetics. I was quite amazed that she put her hands on a piece of modern technology. Because she's usually very afraid of such things.<br />
And even more weird. After we finished she took it and started pushing it's buttons looking all amazed and telling me that: "Wow, look how advanced technology is nowadays, and I still have to calculate these damn calories!"<br />
There's something wrong. Something definetly wrong here!</p>

<p>I created <a href="http://del.icio.us/rev">an account for myself</a> on the "social bookmarks manager" aka <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> (while on the site be sure to check out the <a href="http://del.icio.us/popular/">popular section</a>) and I found it to be such a great tool that I'm thinking about integrating it into this very weblog. Shouldn't be too hard.<br />
Will try to do it right now as a matter of fact.</p>

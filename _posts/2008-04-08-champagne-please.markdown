<p>Entry number 500. FIVE HUNDRED. Whoohoo, hurray me!<br />
Kitsched! - The worthless yekkings of J&aacute;nos Rusiczki - Getting on your nerves <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2002/12/20/restart">since December 2002</a>...<br />
I would like to thank my family, my dogs & cats... You know.<br />
PS. This milestone entry brings with it the oh-so-dreaded comment form captcha which everyone hates but which I was forced to install to save myself from wading through hundreds of spam comments daily. I was fearing the idea of some real feedback getting accidentally categorized as spam. With this plugin installed I'm hoping to return to the <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2008/04/03/all_was_well_in_spamland">spam silence</a> I've been in for 3 years. Oh, and please excuse that I just dropped in the captcha. I'll tune and style it later on.</p>

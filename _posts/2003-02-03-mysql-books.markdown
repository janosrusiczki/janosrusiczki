<p>I didn't went straight to bed yesterday last night. Instead I read some reviews of the book I intended to buy... Turns out it isn't that good actually since it only contains the documentation you can find on the site or included with the software on paper. And I also realized I have it in PDF. Downloaded it some time ago from a binaries group. Only for evaluation purposes of course! :-)<br />
Instead I should further check reviews and opinions on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596001452/026-1593954-2034021" title="by Paul DuBois">MySQL Cookbook</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0735709211/026-1593954-2034021" title="also by Paul DuBois">MySQL</a>.</p>

<p>I just finished watching <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0167404" title="IMDB Link">this movie</a>. And all I can say is: wow! It's a long time since I saw a movie that gave me the shrieks at the end and this one surely did. Such an fantastic twist. And I should also mention that Haley Joel Osment was great. He's a very talented kid.<br />
There's also an interesting story behind me seeing this movie... Because I saw about half of it at Web Web Studio. The first and the last company (up until now at least) where I worked. And it's more than one year since then.<br />
Now I'm getting ready to watch 'The Whole Nine Yards'. Another Bruce Willis movie. Hehe. OK. I'm hurrying to post this actually because it's already on!</p>

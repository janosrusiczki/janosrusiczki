I'm talking about the <i>madness</i> associated with the winter holidays. I think today marked the end of it all, because I slept through most of the day. Relieving myself of almost all of the accumulated tiredness.<br />
The New Year's Eve party wasn't as good as I planned or thought it would be. Why? Because the music mostly sucked. Badly. The average 15 tune playlist looked something like: 6 x R&ouml;yksopp's 'Eple', 3 x Groove Armada's 'Superstylin' and 2 x House of Pain's 'Jump Around'... The rest of the tunes (about 5 or 6) were different but surely heard each of them maximum one hour before. So, the whole playlist was basically repeating the same 10 tunes. The "party people" were not at all "party people" since everybody was sitting instead of shaking their ass. There were rare moments when almost all of the crowd started dancing, but these were really rare. Ah... All that spending caused by buying all those fine drinks... The second night was better. Not a lot better, but at least there was some more dancing and there seemed to be a better atmosphere. We left kind of early anyway.<br />
I don't know what conclusion to draw but I know one thing for sure: if I ever hear that 'Eple' tune again I'll surely smash the thing that's playing it with an axe. God! I surely, forcibly, listened to it at least 15 times in those two nights. It was surely <b>the hit</b> of the New Year's Eve parties...</p>

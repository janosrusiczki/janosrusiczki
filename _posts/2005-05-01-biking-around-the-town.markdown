  content: ! 'Biking is TIP TOP !!

    But don''t throw a sack of money on a new bike, you need just the wheels :).

    Personally i would encourage you to take up skateboarding .. but that''s a little
    to risky .. as you said .. so you already got the answer :)

  content: ! 'We''re going biking too, no surprise here.

    I''ve tried skateboarding but it''s not the same thing and it will never replace
    snowboarding. It''s kinda stupid being on wheels and not being able to turn and
    stuff.

    I guess the only thing left is to go skydiving :D

  content: ! 'I can''t wait to get a new bike.Gonna teach deea to ride once again
    but as i told her , "it''s like riding a bike" no sweat.I don''t encourage you
    to try aggresive in line skating because you''re already used to the snow/skateboard
    style.I started out skating since i was 4 years old and it''s my favourite extreme
    sport.

    it to go to work every day. I dont have a car and I''m not planning to buy one,
    I hate the crowded 41 tram line and it takes me only half an hour to ride to and
    from work every day.

<p>Finally some activity today! I mean physical activity, because since the snow went away I haven't done anything that required muscles and actual physical effort.</p>
<p>Ioana had a great ideea today: she pulled out two bikes (her's and her brother's) from the shed, we blew off the dust that gathered on them over the years, pumped some air into the wheels and off we went! First we cut through the streets around her house, then we rode around the park, paused, rode some more around the park and then we headed back home. After getting off I felt like in the good days back in the winter: tired but great, feeling that I've accomplished something.</p>
<p>This brings me to a question I wanted to ask here on the blog: what do you recommend? What should a snowboard enthusiast do during the summer? There are a few options that came through my mind: rollerblading (never tried it), skateboarding (I think I'm a bit too old to start breaking my bones on the concrete) or biking (yes! - but I should invest in a shiny new bike). For the moment I think I'll stick with biking (on the borrowed bike) but does anyone have any other ideeas?</p>
<p>Don't hesitate: shoot me a comment!</p>

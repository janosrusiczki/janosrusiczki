  content: ! "I actually had one of the best experiences with E-toro, If your new
    to the Forex Trading you might now like it as much as i do. But it's helped out
    ALOT. \r\n\r\nNohthings perfect but i'm pretty sure if you know what you are doing
    you'll find e-toro is at least one of the best. If your new to forex trading.
    do some google'n about the industry first and get your feet wet and then try the
    e-toro demo so you have a better understanding of how everything works.\r\n\r\nI
    see too many people bashing good programs not knowing what they are talking about.
    Another good one is FAP Turbo but... like everything else it's not perfect!"

  content: etoro is the worst site ive used, they are ignorant people who allow one
    nation to take over its chat room and verbally and racist abuse other members,
    and when you complain, they ban you not them. Do not use this site they are not
    to be trusted. there are many better sites out there.

  content: ! "First things first.\r\n\r\nIn the case of leverage the only difference
    is that if you loose you can loose slow or fast same way as if you win.\r\nSo
    if the rate of loosing is the same if you start making profit at x10 you will
    also be making profit at x400 but much more profit, same goes for loosing.\r\n\r\nI
    recommend you to star with the demo account use and learn forex for a month maybe
    two then go for real trade account.\r\n\r\nTo Andrei:\r\nOf course your broker
    said that we wants a share of the cake."

  content: They are a joke. If you want to trade forex, not gamble, manage your risk.  You
    shouldn't risk more than 5% of your account per trade (if you have $1000 on your
    account your maximum risk per all open positions shouldn't be more than $50).  EToro
    is probably a bucket shop as they're based in Israel, have their corporate headquarters
    in Cyprus (where business regulations are hardly existent) and their FTC "legitimacy"
    doesn't mean too much as spot currency markets aren't regulated in the US and
    all over the world.  One of the best firms where you can open an account with
    less than $50,000 is Dukascopy in Switzerland (they also have offices in the US
    and other countries), but for accounts below the 50,000 USD threshold your commission
    rates will be exorbitant by forex standards albeit you'll have access to one of
    the best professional trading platforms in the industry. They are not regulated
    by US laws and you still can hedge your bets by opening offsetting positions to
    lock your losses or profits (plus transaction and carry costs).  And, last but
    not least, if you're set up with them (which is quite a lengthy and meticulous
    process) transfers of your profits is fast and easy. My withdrawal requests sent
    by e-mail, often over $50,000, are processed and completed within 24 to 36 hours
    and the only fees are charged by my bank for receiving the wires.

  content: ! "Hello,\r\nSuccessful trading is about sustaining profitability over
    a period of time and not about gaining or loosing individual trades. Basically,
    you can earn significant returns if you allow yourself to see the larger picture.
    However, traders often make terrible mistakes while trading. This takes place
    when a trader is unsuccessful with a trade they were certain would be a winner.
    As a result a trader has negative feelings of failure and plan revenge against
    their broker. Traders must accept the risk of each trade before they enter their
    position. By removing emotional ties to your trades you will only then see repeatable
    results and realize that your broker may have nothing to do with your misfortunes.\r\n\r\nHappy
    Trading!"

  content: My post was about the broker, not trading.  I do manage my risks and assess
    quality of particular brokers. I also have an account with Interactive Brokers
    and believe that although they are the best for high volume day and swing trading
    of equities, ETFs and options, they are one of the lousiest Forex brokers (I mean
    legitimate brokers, not bucket shops like e-toro) and their charting software
    is a joke (I use third party charts for my equity and options trading).

  content: I do not like etoro because it uses the greed of newbees. Forex is no place
    to make quick buck. If you play with high leverages, believe me you suck big.
    There are many many points in forex trading to consider such as trends, fibos,
    indicators, news.. etc etc. However with etoro, newbees think they can make money
    easily without doing any homework. And they suck big time. Let me give u one example
    and you will see what I mean. One of my newbee friend opened an real account with
    etoro. He was trading even withouth using charts. he only checked the prices window
    where u can only see the rates goes up or down. Can u believe it? He lost all
    the money. Forex is no play and no gamble. It is as serious as a business or  investing
    in stock. You need to be equipped with lots of knowledge and experience. To mee
    etoro looks like a big online casino. Avoid like pleague.

  content: ! 'I know a guy from North Vancouver, BC, Canada, who''s actually made
    a lot of money (over $27,000) and he couldn''t get his profits from them for months,
    and I even don''t know if he did, as I lost all contacts with him a few months
    ago. BTW, e-Toro is an Israeli-based, Cyprus-incorporated on-line gambling operation.
    They accept your credit card and take your money, but they run you through the
    hoops if you want to get back even your initial deposit. And I do agree: Forex
    is a serious business and you''d better know what you''re doing and start following
    global politics and economics, and have at least some basic knowledge of macroeconomics.'

  content: kman,here's the link to the best of the best unless you live in the US.
    http://bit.ly/uxcTmD  CHOOSE ONLY THOSE WHO ARE BANKS AND OFFER MAXIMUM LEVERAGE
    UP TO 100%, NO MORE (OTHERWISE GO TO THE NEAREST CASINO). MY SUGGESTION IS DUKASCOPY.
    If you live in the US, try to go to a bank-owned or reputable independent broker.
    I would suggest Interactive Brokers http://bit.ly/tJZdWd , but be prepared to
    deal with a very confusing accounting system and almost non-existent customer
    service during US stock market hours (long waiting time before you phone call
    is answered, but their customer service reps are very well-trained and almost
    always can adequately address your problems). They offer leverage up to 40% and
    have a decent trade execution platform.

    Greetings

    http://www.etoro.com/A45076_TClick.aspx'
---
<p>Or the fastest way I ever lost $50. Actually "only" $25...</p>
<p>But first of all the I'll answer the question posed in the title of this entry: no. <a href="http://www.etoro.com">eToro</a> is not a scam. However it's very easy to lose money if you're not careful. And unfortunately I wasn't <em>that</em> careful.</p>
<p>And now on to the story. I discovered eToro accidentally and I've spent quite a few days on the demo account to familiarize myself with the system before commiting to deposit. Unfortunately there are some differences when you're dealing with a real account. Differences I didn't know about until after I actually made the deposit. If you read around about Forex trading systems, there are warnings everywhere to only invest money that you afford to lose. And I heeded them, although the $50 required as the minimum amount to be deposited is at the top of my "I can gamble that" threshold. On the demo I wasn't actually trading currencies but commodities, more specifically gold and as it was going very low I thought hey, I can't go wrong with this, it has to climb back to a "normal" rate sometime and that could earn a bit of money. I could even set a "take profit" limit and have the computer work for me...</p>
<p>This is where I went wrong. You see, on the demo account they give you 2000 virtual dollars to play around with (and you can request more by contacting customer care) and this gives you the ability to use low leverages. To be short: leverage gives you the ability to "move" a large sum of money by using a small amount of money. So I made my deposit and clicked the commodities tab only to find out that the minimum amount of money I should have had to be able to start one trade with gold was $200. Nasty. Clicking back to the Forex tab I received another blow: with $50 deposited one could only initiate two trades and these trades are incredibly risky as you're using a 400x leverage. You can indeed win big with this leverage but it's a lot more likely that you'll lose big. You see when you initiate a trade there's a "stop loss" defined and with a 400x leverage it all becomes very sensitive. What I mean is that if the exchange rate suddenly moves by a few thousandths of a unit, you're not there to close your trade in time and your trade's stop loss is tipped you lose all the money you invested in the trade. Even if the rate later returns, your money is gone. Lower leverages give you less profit but the currency can fluctuate quite a lot without risking too much. But lower leverages require more money. With 400x trades you're practically playing an action game watching the 1 minute charts, keeping a close eye on the slightest modifications in the exchange rate and hitting the close trade button at the right time.</p>
<p>And this is where another downside of eToro comes into play. While the interface is butter smooth in demo mode but there are serious lags when switching to real money trading. And it's not my imagination, many others are also complaining about this around the web. And these lags can cost.</p>
<p>I stopped when my balance went under $25 and I couldn't initiate another trade. Now we'll see if my withdrawal request will actually yield because the process sort of started out on the wrong foot as I requested the withdrawal to be made via PayPal yesterday and today they've sent me an e-mail requesting my bank account details and stating that I've requested the money by wire transfer. I politely replied that they're wrong, and even their interface confirms this. (I'll keep you posted on how this all progresses - watch this post for updates.)</p>
<p>I wrote this post to give others a chance to learn from my mistakes before commiting to deposit. Hopefully...</p>

    thing is it doesn''t modify my pictures folder in order to arrange them but hey,
    that was just lazy me talking here... :)

  content: ! 'I read and I''m really curious what will emerge from this joint venture.
    Personally I think Google was more interested in Picasa''s Hello, the company''s
    picture sharing utility which is already well integrated with one of Google''s
    earlier acquisitions, Blogger.

Following <a href="http://www.timbru.com/jurnal/2004/Jul/gen_iphoto_pentru_windows">a post</a> by <a href="http://www.timbru.com">Gabriel Radic</a> I downloaded <a href="http://www.picasa.com/">Picasa</a> and since then, I'm using it almost exclusively when it comes to browsing my digital photo collection. I basically rediscovered the joy of looking at my photos, the joy I lost after about a year of using my late PowerShot A20...<br />
They say this software resembles <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphoto">iPhoto</a> and I can't really say whether it does or doesn't since I never saw iPhoto working, but I can say it's incredibly smooth and intuitive. It doesn't have fancy picture editing features (but who needs that when you have Photoshop?) but it's got all the functions I need when looking at my photos, like rotating the picture or the red-eye reduction (one of the best algorithms I saw).<br />
What can I say? Hello Picasa, and welcome into my life. :-)</p>

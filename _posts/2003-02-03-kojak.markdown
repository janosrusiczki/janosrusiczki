<p>Almost...<br />
I cut my hair a few days ago. And it's weird. Because as long as I can remember I had longer (not long but not short either) hair. And now down to 1 cm (or something around it) is quite weird. I'm often forgetting about it. I had / have the habit of putting my hand through my hair. But now my hand doesn't find any resistance up on my head. Because the resistance is lying now somewhere in a trash can.<br />
The first thought when I first saw myself in the mirror after I came home was that I look like some crude soldier. Soldier... Even the thought of being a soldier gives me the shrieks.<br />
Anyway I'm happy with it. It's more comfortable than the "long" hair. And I did wanted a change.</p>

  content: ! 'Hello, since your entry was written in 2003 I wonder if you would update
    me on CD-R quality. I just bought an HHBCDR830 Burn-it (for home use) and I am
    paranoid about CD-R quality. Do you have any new info? Grace

<p>I'm paranoid about the quality of some of the CD media I'm purchasing so I was quite happy when I found <a href="http://www.cdmediaworld.com/hardware/cdrom/cd_quality.shtml">this page</a> which talks exactly about this. It looks like the TDK CDs I'm buying score well just as my own experience tells me. To properly identify my discs I use <a href="http://www.cdspeed2000.com/go.php3?link=download.html">Nero InfoTool</a> which is a free download and provides lots more detail than I want to know, but obviously include all the relevant data about my CD writer and the disc that happens to be inserted.<br />
I said that I'm concerned about the quality of <i>some</i> of the media I'm buying because there's a lot of junk that gathers up on my hard drives which I can't just throw in the Recycle Bin. So I put burn these on not-so-good CDRs. The results? I usually need something of that junk badly and I can't read the CDs I myself wrote with my own CD burner... Bad.</p>

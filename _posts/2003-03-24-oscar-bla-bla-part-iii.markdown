<p>Woaaa!!! Now this was an antiwar speech! It gave me the shivers!!! But somehow I knew this would happen. It was a great speech. He's got some guts.<br />
And of course that Steve Martin made a joke about it.<br />
Look. There's Kevin Spacey. Too bad he haven't done anything worthy this year... Hehe. Shrek found a practical use for the statuette it seems.<br />
"This is his ass, these are my lips. *KISS*" :-)<br />
Another technical award for Chicago.<br />
Yes Steve, you're right, Hale Berry is hot.<br />
Adrien Brody... I envy him. That kiss he gave Hale Berry. And taking the statue away from those huge players (Cage, Nicolson, Caine, Day Lewis). Really touching speech. Standing ovation. Fantastic. And I don't know anything about this guy... I should really fill some knowledge holes.<br />
Music. Eminem? Shit. I don't like this...</p>

<p>I sent <a href="http://www.beatport.com">them</a> an e-mail complaining that none of my debit cards are accepted for payment on December the 7th, they replied requesting some data about the card and the bank that issued it, which I quickly provided and since then nothing. It's the 27th... Talk about speedy problem resolution!<br />
And no, there are no problems with my cards, I've been shopping with them without any problems. And in many cases right after Beatport refused my payment (I tried several times before giving up and sending the aforementioned e-mail) I went to another, more expensive, shop where I payed for my tracks with the very same card... So there were enough funds - it's just that one day they decided to stop accepting my orders - and not only mine... I think this has to do with the fact that they started billing European customers differently without any official statement whatsoever. I mean, how professional is that?<br />
What's worse, any real complaints about this issue posted to <a href="http://www.beatport.com/forums/">their forums</a> are nicely deleted because all must be pink and happy there. I saw complete topics disappearing in a matter of minutes. That's good thinking: instead of solving the user's problems let's gag those losers. Shame! Look, I'll make a small test and post a link to this entry. I wonder how long it'll stay on?<br />
Oh well, if they don't want my money, there are plenty of other digital download services out there. I guess I'll just move on.<br />
<strong>UPDATE</strong> As it happens in these cases, a few hours after posting this entry (and sending another e-mail to support) they responded and "unlocked" my account. I just made a test purchase and it worked out fine. All this after a couple of months of painful hiatus...</p>

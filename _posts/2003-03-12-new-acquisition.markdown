<p>I bought a microwave oven yesterday.<br />
Now I'm microwaving everything! Really. Even things that do not really need to be microwaved. I microwave them. I ate 2 microwaved sandwiches earlier. And now I'm drinking some hot, microwaved, tea.<br />
I really like new stuff. And I like new stuff even more if it's, no, not microwaved, but some kind of electric power driven thing.</p>

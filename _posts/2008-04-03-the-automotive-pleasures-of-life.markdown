<p>Hey, I have to share this.<br />
I just LOVE driving up to my parents house in Baia Sprie after work. I like being alone in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/janos/1777770142/">the car</a> with my music and my thoughts. I just hope I won't smash into something or someone as a result of being too absorbed. But I generally like driving. A LOT. And I'm not having these driving sessions just for the sake of driving, I usually do the 2 by 10 kilometers to pick up something I received by mail. As I still list my Baia Sprie address although I live in Baia Mare since 2004...<br />
Of course I also have the "pick up Ioana after work by car" driving session each day. But that's not half as fun because I have to cross a really cramped town at around 6 PM. Unfortunately the stress that results from taking care that wreckless idiots won't hit our beloved little car takes away the joy of it.<br />
Next week is looking good from this driving point of view as we're going on a short holiday to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/?q=balea&ss=2&z=t" title="Concentrate your attention on the lake and mountain photos...">Balea</a> and that means crossing half of the country by car. And back. Hmmm, I'm off to write some mix CDs and praise my <a href="http://www.friskyradio.com">friskyRadio</a> subscription.</p>

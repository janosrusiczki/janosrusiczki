  content: ! 'Too funny! But in all seriousness, this type of stuff has got to stop
    and I''m happy to hear you guys speaking out on it. The 1900 leap year bug =>
    standard thing is just too comical. Why no comment? They could have at least said
    something about that!

    We can''t let the monkeys run the ship...I don''t my code looking like theirs!

    "we saw over the past few weeks some strange and rather irregular national positions
    coming to light. My own favorites were Cuba voting "yes" to the fast-tracking
    of OOXML, even though Microsoft is prohibited by the US Government from selling
    any software on the island that might even be able to read and write the new format,
    and Azerbaijan''s "yes" vote, even though OOXML as defined isn''t able to express
    a Web URL address in Azeri, their official language."

<p>Just read this on <a href="http://www.cianblog.com/">Lucian Savluc's blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I just found from one of the ROSI members (<a href="http://www.rolix.org/">Laurentiu Buzdugan</a>), that Romanian Standard Association (<a href="http://www.asro.ro/">ASRO</a>) was one of the few countries representatives who <a href="http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070904082606181">approved without any comments</a> the Microsoft OOXML proposal! (For those who are not familiar with it, there is a quite straight forward explanation on Wikipedia about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OOXML">OOXML</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">ODF</a>.) Can you imagine? No comments or nothing, they just say “OK, we totally agree with Office Open XML”!</p></blockquote>
<p>This is nothing short of disgusting... In a world where countries straight out refuse the format because, well, it's <b>REDUNDANT</b> to say the least, Romania just accepts it without any comments. I don't even think they studied what it is or anything, they saw Microsoft written on it and they accepted. What do you mean, why!? Because it's Microsoft, stupid!</p>
<p>Well, I'm pretty sure nothing can be done for Romania to unswallow MS's (no bad words today) but FYI here's the banner linking to the 6 unanswered questions on MS OOXML asked by the <a href="http://fsfeurope.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>:</p>

<p>Read and judge for yourself.</p>

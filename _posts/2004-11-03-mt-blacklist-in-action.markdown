<p><img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/mt_blacklist_stats.gif" width="217" height="182" alt="MT-Blacklist Statistics" class="postimage" /> It's working! Not one spam comment went through since <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/11/01/mt_3121_dynamic_pages_and_the_return_of_the_blacklist">I installed it</a> two days ago, it blocked 22 because they matched 'cialis' and forced me to moderate another two of them because they were added to older entries. That's what I call a smart plug-in! Kudos to the author, <a href="http://www.jayallen.org/">Jay Allen</a>.<br />
As another conclusion it looks like changing the name of the comment script had no effect and this could mean one of two things: they have smart little bots or all the comments are added by hand. If it's the latter case, I wonder where do they get all the workforce? It must be one hell of a boring job!</p>

<p>A quote from the <a href="http://www.dol.ro">Diverta Online</a> newsletter I received yesterday (translated):</p>
<blockquote><p>[...] The motion picture based on the book "Cold Mountain" (shot in Romania) won the Oscar for Actress in a Leading Role - Nicole Kidman</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, paying a short visit to the <a href="http://www.oscar.com">official site</a> of the 76th Annual Academy Awards and following the link leading to the <a href="http://www.oscar.com/oscarnight/winners/index.html">winners list</a> proves that the 'Send Newsletter' button was pushed in a hurry somewhere in Bucharest. The actual winner for Actress in a Leading Role is Charlize Theron for Monster and the winner for Actress in a Supporting Role is Ren&eacute;e Zellweger for Cold Mountain.<br />
Conclusion? Don't send out newsletters containing infos based on bits you remember from last night when you watched that Oscar show but in the meantime had some beers with your friends...</p>

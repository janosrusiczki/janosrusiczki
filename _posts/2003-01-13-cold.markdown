<p>It's cold. It's really cold. I'm not complaining since I wanted this so much. But I'm sitting in my room. The stove is right beside me (about 1 meter). It's so hot I can't touch it. Still my feet are freezing.<br />
Well I guess tomorrow I could celebrate the cold again. On the slopes. Hehe.</p>

<p>Steve Martin:<br />
"I loved Lord Of The Rings. That was a great download."<br />
"Hosting the Oscars for the second time is like making love to a woman the second time. I guess."<br />
"Uuuh! Sorry, I thought I saw a non-celebrity..."<br />
"There are no losers tonight. But we're about to change that."<br />
Lord Of The Rings starts to harvest technical awards again.<br />
I haven't seen many of the movies of tonight's Oscars but I liked <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Name?Cooper%2C+Chris+(I)">Chris Cooper</a> a lot back then, in <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0169547" title="One of my favourite movies...">American Beauty</a> and his speech was impressive.<br />
Oh look: J Lo presenting an award...</p>

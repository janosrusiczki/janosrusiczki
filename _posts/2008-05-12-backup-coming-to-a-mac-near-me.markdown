  content: ! 'Congratulations for your new HDD! Having "unlimited" storage space can
    get you drunk with power :-)

    I got myself a 500 Lacie mini a while ago. It''s gorgeous, but noisy like crop
    duster. I''ll write a post on my new blog about it soon.

  content: ! 'OK, I''ve found it. It was really hard, I clicked your name under the
    comment and in one shot I secured myself comment ID number two. Right after Mr.
    Wordpress. Geeky achievements.

    Now, back on topic: the WD My Book I have is quite noisy too. As I said it''s
    networked, it sits in our room right next to the router and sometimes after we
    go to bed Ioana''s brother starts copying stuff to or from it and this usually
    means no sleep for us until he''s at it... It''s not THAT loud but it''s annoying.

<p>Good news day.</p>
<p>1. First and most important: I've got a raise. Whooo. A raise is always excellent news.<br />
2. A replacement arrived for the 400 gig hard drive that flew away to the ethernal bit fields with most of my music archive on it a few months ago. Oh, how happy I was about that incident. Not. I tried to avoid thinking about it as much as I could but these weeks I was in the mood to listen to a specific style of which I had several gigs of MP3s on that drive. Bad luck.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the good news: I'll have a spanking new hard drive ready for action! The plan is to put it into my desktop PC bringing the number of drives installed up to three. Hmmm, let's brag a bit. Desktop PC: 320 GB + 500 GB + 400 GB (the newcomer) = 1,12 TB! Wow. 500 GB <a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/Products.asp?DriveID=278">Western Digital My Book World Edition</a> that sits near my router tied into the network. Two 80 GB drives of which one is installed into my PlayStation 2 and one is in a portable USB enclosure. The one in the USB enclosure will be used for Time Machine backups from now on... 60 GB hard in my MacBook.</p>
<p>And I remember the moment in the autumn of 1998 when I decided to get a 4 GB hard drive thinking that it'll last me, like, forever.</p>

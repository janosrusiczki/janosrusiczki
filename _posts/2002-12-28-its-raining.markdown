<p>Great news after great news. After a bit of snow last night, now it's raining in some really small drops. Plus nice fog. Everything is melting away. It's great. Chances for snowboarding are getting bigger day by day. Fuck. I knew this would happen if I buy myself a board. I just wonder how did it happen that last winter actually I caught a nice weather, suitable for boarding? Probably to raise my appetite. To make the pill even more bitter.<br />
It seems like a perfect day for upgrading PHP and do some other computer related work.<br />
Damn.</p>

<p>Oh, how I wish I would have PHP on my Palm. But then again. If I think about it...<br />
What's given: The 8 Megs of RAM of the Palm m500.<br />
Which are the requirements: Squeeze a web server, MySQL, PHP and a browser into <b>that</b>. It might not be impossible. But a laptop is a much more straightforward solution.<br />
Time for another, more realistic, wish... :-)</p>

<p>I don't think any normal human being would play Tetris like <a href="http://www.nordheim.no/stuff/tetris_japan_finals.mpeg" title="Tetris Japan Finals">this</a> guy does. Japonese people are sick! I wonder though, how much practice does it take to play like this? Or maybe some are you born for it?<br />

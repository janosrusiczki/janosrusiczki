<p>... this is the question.</p>
<p>Tonight a thought that has been circling in my mind for some time returned with a vengeance: let's register <a href="http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/">Tweetie</a> and <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a>! But then I remembered that the slight inconvenience about having these apps unregistered are the ads delivered via <a href="http://fusionads.net/">Fusion</a> and <a href="http://decknetwork.net/">The Deck</a> respectively. Which both serve quality ads and actually helped me discover a couple of cool applications and services I might have missed otherwise. So please Mac developers, pick worse quality ad providers if you want me to register your apps. :-) </p>

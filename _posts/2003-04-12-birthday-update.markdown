<p>Oh, and I'm not celebrating my birthday today, since the bar where I wanted to take the gang to get everybody happy by getting them drunk is taken by somebody else for tonight... I found out about this Wednesday in the evening and I was quite disappointed plus I had to announce everyone in time that it's not today.<br />
So the <b>updated</b> countdown looks like this: 5 days until I turn 24 and 7 days until we celebrate this huuuge event. Hehe.<br />
And now time for a some exercise: Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday, Wednesday... Repetition is the mother of all knowledge they say but I just can't remember how this day is written...<br />
<b>Update update:</b> For those too lazy to count, I was born on the 17th of April, 1979. Now pack those socks... :-)</p>

<p>OK, one last update. It's a list of updates in fact, so here it goes...<br />
My review is finally completely posted, check out <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/10/19/another_edition_is_over_part_1">part 1 (the intro)</a>, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/10/28/another_edition_is_over_the_late_part_2">part 2 (the first day of party)</a> and <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/11/01/another_edition_is_over_the_not_so_late_part_3">part 3 (the second day of party)</a>. Also, I just added a bunch of <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/gallery/tm04base_personal_photos/">personal photos</a> from the event to my gallery.<br />
Yesterday, the guys from TMBase updated their page and added Constantin Duma's photos (<a href="http://www.tmbase.ro/gallery.php?lang=ro&amp;thisDir=2004.10.14-tm04base_day_1">Thursday</a>, <a href="http://www.tmbase.ro/gallery.php?lang=ro&amp;thisDir=2004.10.15-tm04base_day_2">Friday</a> and <a href="http://www.tmbase.ro/gallery.php?lang=ro&amp;thisDir=2004.10.16-tm04base_day_3">Saturday</a>) which are absolutely fantastic. I don't know how Mr. Duma does it because I must admit, I followed him with my eyes for a while to try to catch some of his secrets but I saw nothing out of the ordinary except a (probably) very expensive digital camera and careful staging of each photo. Anyway in my opinion those pictures should be nominated for some party photography prize...<br />
And finally, <a href="http://www.4elemente.ro">4elemente</a> posted <a href="http://www.4elemente.ro/Evenimente/event18.htm">a nice review</a> of the event in Romanian. It's the most well written review out there.<br />
That's all folks. No more TMBase related stuff for a while. I promise.</p>

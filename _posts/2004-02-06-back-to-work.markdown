<p>Although my exam period is officially over as of today I still have one exam on the 11th. A retry of the exam I blew last year's second semester. And I have a lot to learn for that exam. A lot. But as usual life is not that simple.<br />
I miscalculated my budget a little with all the spending I did lately so I've got some problems now. Financial problems to be more precise. But there's a solution and it's called work. So I'm waking up early tomorrow and I'll try to finish a site for my french partner that's long due to be finished. I love working in the mornings because that's the part of the day I'm most productive. I hope I'll succeed finishing that site...</p>

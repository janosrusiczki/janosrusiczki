<p><a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2008/06/04/boom">I wrote</a> about the issues at <a href="http://www.theplanet.com">The Planet</a> right at the end of my first month with them. Back then I was wondering what kind of compensation will I get for the downtime. Well, this morning I found the support ticket closed with a notification informing me that I've got a full month worth of refund. Wow, one month of free service for a few days of downtime. Now that's what I call generosity!</p>

Yep! It simply does. Even if it's a beta.<br />
Those looks! That functionality! I don't know whatever happened to version 4, but I don't really care. I wouldn't touch version 3 even if it was the last media player on Earth (well maybe in that case I'd make an exception) because it sucks sooo badly.<br />
But <a href="http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=152845">this version</a> is way cool!</p>

<p>Not much happening. I should learn but I don't. Exams come and go. Some I take. Some not. I should work but I don't. Projects are on hold.<br />
But each day is a boarding day to fully celebrate and bow before the Almighty Winter! And I just purely love every small hour, every little minute and every tiny second I spend on the slopes. That feeling, whoa! Too bad it's getting dark kind of quick and I (we in fact, as most of the time I go with a friend) have to hurry down from the woods. So the fun lasts only for 2 or 3 hours each day. But it's fun. Lots of fun!</p>

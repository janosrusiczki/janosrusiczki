<p>I silently sneaked them in a while ago but they turned out to be more of an annoyance than a feature. So they're out. I just hope I deleted the relevant JavaScript snippet from all my templates. If you're annoyed by them on other sites here's a link to <a href="http://www.snap.com/about/spa_faq.php#2">the gizmo's FAQ</a> which explains how to turn them off. Or if you don't trust cookies and you're using Firefox with the Adblock add-on installed you can easily <a href="http://myvogonpoetry.com/wp/2007/01/19/how-to-remove-snapcom-from-sites-you-browse/">ban the whole script</a>.</p>

<p>After just a little more than a week of cable Internet access what I can say is: it's good to be back. It's good to be able to leave my <a href="http://www.sharpreader.net/" title="Sharpreader">favorite newsreader</a> open all the time, have an <a href="http://www.poptray.org" title="PopTray - It's incredible!">email notification utility</a> autocheck all my 7 active email accounts every 10 minutes, have friends download pictures and other stuff from my personal FTP, leave my webcam open almost all the time, play some games online when I'm bored and I haven't said anything yet about the continuous download action I'm doing. It's never been this good since 2001 when I was doing all this on a now defunct company's money. But wheels turn, and even if it's my money I'm playing with now it's still better than great. Au revoir dial-up times... I hope forever.<br />
If only the exams and this other thing called work wouldn't bother me...</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/lyrics/code-monkey" title="Click play">this song</a> by listening to <a href="http://www.twit.tv/ITN">net@nite</a> (with Leo Laporte and Amber MacArthur) and I must say it's one good dose of fun. Not to mention how catchy the tune and true the lyrics are. I quickly passed it on to my coder contacts on IM and of course they all had their share of fun. Because, did I mention the song is catchy, fun and true? Oh yes, I did.</p>
<p>Another thing I kept hearing about in <a href="http://www.leoville.com">Leo</a>'s shows (<a href="http://www.twit.tv/TWiT">TWiT</a> and net@nite to be more precise) is <a href="http://twitter.com">Twitter</a>. So today I gave in to my curiosity and created <a href="http://twitter.com/kitsched">an account</a> on this service created by the founder of Blogger and Odeo. What is it? It's an "away message" site. What do I mean by that? Well, you must have at least one contact on your IM who sets away messages like "eating", "taking a shower", "out in town" basically letting everyone on their buddy list know about every small step of their life. Well, Twitter is a dream come true for them. And not only them. In a nutshell: tell the world what you're doing in less than 140 characters. The nice thing about it is that you can do this either by going to their site, by sending an IM or by sending an SMS. So you can keep everyone posted even while you're offline (but in cell coverage area). Pretty neat!</p>
<p>And one more thing. About those long promised snowboard reports. If I'm so late with them, what the heck, I'll just wait for the season to end and I'll post one final but comprehensive review. And as much as it hurts saying this I'll have to say that it's more than sure that this season will end this weekend. And that is just not fair. Winter is supposed to be 3 months plus extras not a measly 1 month. Bah!</p>

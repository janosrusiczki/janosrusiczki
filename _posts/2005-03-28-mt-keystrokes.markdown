<p>Hey spammers, bite my shiny metal... <a href="http://overstated.net/projects/mt-keystrokes/">MT-Keystrokes</a>. Wow! I could almost say that this is the best invention since sliced bread! It's based on such a simple ideea but it proves to be really effective in practice.<br />
I saw the plugin a while ago, but when I tried to install it back then instead of my dynamically generated individual entry pages I saw errors because the plugin had no support for them. But yesterday after deleting about 30 notification e-mails MT-Blacklist sent me I got a little fed up and I decided that I'd better save myself from this kind of crap and revert to static individual entry pages just to be able to put MT-Keystrokes to work. But when I visited the project's homepage I noticed that it now supports dynamic pages. Oh JOY!<br />
Installation was a breeze and consisted of uploading 2 files and editing one template. And it works perfectly judging from the fact that since yesterday it blocked well over 100 junk comments.<br />
Blog life is pink now. At least for a while...</p>

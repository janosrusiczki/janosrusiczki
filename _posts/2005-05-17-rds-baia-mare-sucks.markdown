    isn''t it?

    Try to be optimistic and maybe sometime, somewhere ... things will be diferent.
    In the good way.

  content: ! 'RDS is a very chaotic company. (it can be applied also to RCS-the cable
    company). You can never rely on them, on what they do or what they say they''ll
    do. But I like them. Primarely because they provide internet at a very convenient
    cost. Plus telephony. The speed is decent, the interruptions in service are frequent
    indeed but for a home user is OK. I would have chosen another company if there
    was any, but there isn''t.

  content: ! 'Well things are a litlle bit different where i live. That''s in Bucharest.
    Ok, at first RDS convinced me as well that the service it provides it''s cheap
    but of low quality. Since then things have improved.The modem doesn''t lose signal
    so often, i can''t remember the last time it did, so connection is much better.
    Still, as a reply to the earlier statements, regarding the speed, things are almost
    the same but not quite. Meaning, during day and night the speed remains the same
    30 kb.s.

  content: ! 'Interesting observation: RDS is very expansionistic. ASTRAL builds vertically.

    Personally I "live" on neither, but on the node of a very old provider (named
    fx, one of the first and most innovative in Romania, now gulped by ASTRAL - but
    totally different infrastructure, linked only at one point). When half of bucharest
    doesn''t have net (it actually happens!), I still do :D But I only get the exact
    32kBps I pay for, no famous "120kB/s RDS spikes" they report in the neighbourhood.

    Modem desyncs were something daily till spring, then they replaced a 10Base-5
    (was yellow now is orange) and everything is OK now.

    Btw, RDS is losing ground because local networks and Romtelecom''s new "cheap"
    service (whitch isn''t cheap, isn''t fast, isn''t mobile, but gets a lot of publicity)
    and is in panic. That explains their move.

<p>Yesterday I was home in my (extended) lunch break and as I was downloading something right before my eyes the speed went up to something around 90kB/s. What the!? It stayed there for a few minutes, the files were flowing in and then it dropped back to 30kB/s which is still double the speed I get during the day. I thought the guys at RDS were messing around with their config and something went wrong but as I got back to work I opened the <a href="http://www.rdslink.ro">RDSLink</a> page and there it was. <a href="http://www.rdslink.ro/stiri/stire7.htm">Good news.</a> Great news in fact.<br />
It looks like they tripled the transfer speed of my subscription and lowered the price by 10 bucks! Oh Lord! As you can imagine, J&aacute;nos, once nicknamed "download boy" was in a complete joygasm. But it didn't last too long. Because exactly what I've been expecting happened: I was still at work at around 7:30 - 8 PM (that's what I get for those extended lunch breaks) when all the kids finish their homework and get on the Net and so the cable modem at my workplace desynced and stood like that for a good 45 minutes or so. And I know exactly why this happened: their infrastructure sucks. Ass. Oh, and phone support was busy or not answering. Right on! I knew they started having problems right after <a href="http://www.canal7.ro">Canal 7</a> was acquired by <a href="http://www.rdsnet.ro">RDS</a> and they raised the speed to 256kbps last year. That's why I was strongly wondering how will they support 768kbps... They didn't.<br />
As I'm writing these lines the speed is back to the old standard of 15kB/s during the day and 30kB/s by night (as I saw in the download logs). I'm wondering if this is happening nationwide or only in our wonderful little town? Because if it's the latter case I'll be reeealy pissed!</p>

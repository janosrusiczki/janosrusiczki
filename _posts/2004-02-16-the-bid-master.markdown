<p>Nowadays I'm not only bidding and buying for myself on my beloved <a href="http://www.okazii.ro/" title="The Romanian equivalent of Ebay">Okazii.ro</a> but also for my neighbours and friends. The positive side of this is that my rating on that site will see a constant rise in the near future. But in fact I myself am not a big buyer lately because I'm out of money and I can't really get back to a constant working rate which would earn me some cash. I hope I'll pick up the pace soon though because there are many tasks to be done down the line. And they're piling up as the days go by...</p>

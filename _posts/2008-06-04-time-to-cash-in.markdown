  content: ! '"Over 300,000 people have visited this page in the first week and thousands
    are joining every day! Growing faster and faster every minute, this program propagates
    extremely fast."  - right.. and we''re supposed to believe that they''re paying

<p>Big time.</p>
<p>I've just discovered the following e-mail in my Junk folder. How could I have missed it!? Such a stellar opportunity!</p>
<blockquote><p>Hi,</p>
<p>We've seen your website at <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2008/05/15/tinyurlcom_became_so_tiny_its_inaccessible">http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/...</a> and we love it!</p>
<p>We see that your traffic rank is 2070406 and your link popularity is 35.<br />
Also, you have been online since 11/9/2003.</p>
<p>With that kind of traffic, we will pay you up to $4,800/month to advertise our links on your website.</p>
<p>If you're interested, read our terms from this page:<br />
--== OBVIOUSLY REMOVED ==--</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Nikolaos Koufakis<br />
The --== REMOVED ==-- Network</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course the e-mail comes from a weird looking Yahoo address but this means nothing. Serious companies always send their mails from Yahoo addresses. So truly hyped, I click the link in a hurry. A friendly female voice greets me enticing me to add those links to my site and I can win 4800 in a month. 9600 the second month. And then it get into the sci-fi territory speaking about monthly earnings that are twice the price of my car. And all this for just a few links listed on my site. Sounds too good to be true? Maybe a little.</p>
<p>OK. After listening to the message and being all full of quick cash adrenaline I start reading the site:</p>
<blockquote><p>After millions of dollars invested and over 2 years in development, we've just launched the fastest growing program since Google Adwords and as viral as Hotmail.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hm. Quite weird there was nothing about them on <a href="http://techcrunch.com">TechCrunch</a>...</p>
<blockquote><p>Over 300,000 people have visited this page in the first week and thousands are joining every day! Growing faster and faster every minute, this program propagates extremely fast.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, <strike>spam</strike> e-mail is a highly effective way to attract potential <strike>victims</strike> partners.</p>
<blockquote><p>And even if you only show our links for one month, we'll keep on paying you that $4,800 EVERY MONTH! *</p></blockquote>
<p>Holy crap! I've almost entered an uncontrollable money frenzy at this point. But waaait a minute. There's a footnote. I see the little asterisk. Let's scroll down:</p>
<blockquote><p>* These figures of earnings are examples to help you understand the earning potential - You can make more or less. There are no guarantees of income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aha. So getting past the bullshit most likely I'll get nada. Zilch. Nothing. And for this nada I give them (or their customers) valuable inbound links for 1 month. Or for however long it takes for me to realize I've been scammed. Well, thank you. I think I'll pass.</p>
<p>Anyway, from now on I'll sleep much sounder knowing that someone out there "loves" my website. Yey!</p>

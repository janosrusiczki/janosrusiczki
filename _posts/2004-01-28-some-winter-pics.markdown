<p>As <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2004/01/27/cold_exams_more_memory_and_some_books" title="Kitsched - Cold, exams, more memory and some books">I already mentioned</a>, I was out snowboarding with my friend Mircea, and he took some pics with me on my board. So, <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/snowboard_jumping.jpg" title="455 kBytes">here I am jumping</a> on a quite steep hill and later that day <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/snowboard_riding_smoothly.jpg" title="522 kBytes">I'm riding down a smooth hill</a> (yes, I'm kind of small in this pic). When I took the camera in my hand I quickly snapped <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/baia_sprie_is_down_in_the_fog.jpg" title="765 kBytes">a photo of the mountains and hills around my town</a> (Baia Sprie, or Fels&ouml;b&aacute;nya if you wish, in the north-western part of Romania). The fog down in the valley completely covers the town... I really like this pic and the first pic (the one with me jumping) was the first photo ever containing me I set as a desktop wallpaper.</p>

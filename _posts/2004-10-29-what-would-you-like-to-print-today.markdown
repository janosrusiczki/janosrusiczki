Yesterday night I printed the <a href="http://home.tampabay.rr.com/bmerkey/cheatsheet.htm">Cascading Style Cheatsheet</a> put together by Brett Merkey, which will surely come in handy a number of times. <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/linkblog/">My linkblog</a> was very handy this time as I have no printer of my own and I was over at a friend who I asked if I could print. And there I was, two clicks and the printer was busy. Thanks Peti.</p>

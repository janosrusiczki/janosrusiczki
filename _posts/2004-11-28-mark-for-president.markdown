  content: ! 'What about the 2nd round? Are you going to follow party politics and
    vote Nastase just because of the backstabbing and power-brokering?

    If the germans and hungarians in Romania fancy themselves as the more enlightened,
    most closer to the West citizens, as I too think they are, how come they make
    deals with parties like PSD?

    don''t ask me about politics. I don''t know, I don''t think I''m going to vote

Yeah, I actually went to vote this year... With my parents. Not that I care too much or even know too much about politics. The good news is that 30 minutes after taking this picture I was on the slopes trying out my new second hand <a href="http://www.nidecker.ch">Nidecker</a> snowboard I bought a few days ago. And all I can say is that it's PERFECT! Whoppiedoo!<br />
PS. Sorry for the low quality of the photo but that's all that my T610 can do.</p>

<p>Not much happening.<br />
Hot, late-summer days go by. I should work but instead I stare most of the time at my computer's monitor. Doing various stuff. Nothing really important. Moving MP3s from one folder to another and other challenging stuff like this.<br />
There should be some camping action during the weekend. But there are some factors. Because we (they) don't know exactly when they want to go. Friday or Saturday. I go if we go Friday but I better go to the disco if they go on Saturday. I hope we go Friday though because I really feel the need to burn my throat with some tequilla or some other dangerous beverages. The call of the wild.<br />
I think I'll do some work now, though. Because I have some dreams. And to fulfill your dreams you need money. At least <em>I</em> need money to fulfill <em>my</em> dreams. Yeah. So, let's fire up <a href="http://www.editplus.com">EditPlus</a>.<br />

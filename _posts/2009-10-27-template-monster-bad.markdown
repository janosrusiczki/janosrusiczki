  content: ! "I found an article which perfectly reflects what I wanted to tell in
    this post.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>So, visual designers, here's a list of 20 things
    that drive developers crazy. If you're not doing at least 15, then you're not
    trying hard enough.\r\n\r\n1. Add rounded corners to every single element on the
    page. While you're at it, add shadows and gradients too.\r\n\r\n2. Use the same
    PSD as a starting point for every project. Hide unused layers, but don't delete
    them. Make sure your PSD is at least 100MB.\r\n\r\n3. Use sIFR on every piece
    of text. Bonus points if you choose a font that's very similar to Arial.\r\n\r\n4.
    Never use the same dimensions on elements. Give each a different font size and
    colour (for black, use #000000, #111111, #121212 ...).\r\n\r\n5. Use a lot of
    breakout images with transparency. Web developers love graphics breaking out of
    boxes and columns. Bonus points if you add text wrapping around images.\r\n\r\n6.
    Add a modal window. At least half the site should happen in a modal window.\r\n\r\n7.
    Add a Facebook Connect button. It's just a button. How hard can it be to implement?\r\n\r\n8.
    Hide important PSD layers. Later, tell the developer that they missed a hidden
    element.\r\n\r\n9. Create buttons with rollover, active and clicked states. Then
    don't tell anyone you've done this. Create a separate file for them and send it
    on at the last minute. We love surprises.\r\n\r\n10. Tell the developer about
    some fancy functionality you read about somewhere on a blog. Then tell them to
    build it, because, if you saw it somewhere, clearly it's possible.\r\n\r\n11.
    Add a carousel. Oh yeah, and make sure it's a full-screen carousel.\r\n\r\n12.
    Use Lorem Ipsum instead of real copy. And make sure the reserved space is not
    big enough for real copy.\r\n\r\n13. Randomly merge PSD layers. Why not? (But
    don't merge too many. It'll take you further away from the magic 100MB target).\r\n\r\n14.
    Name all your files 'final', plus a date and a random letter (final-2010-12-01a.psd,
    final- 2010-12-01r.psd, final-2010-12-02b.psd).\r\n\r\n15. Don't worry about making
    changes once everything is signed off. When we're done with a page, send another,
    completely different version of it. And tell us that those changes are necessary
    and essential for user experience.\r\n\r\n16. Don't name or organise your PSD
    layers and folders.\r\n\r\n17. If you're designing a form, forget about error
    and success states. We'll squeeze that stuff in somewhere. We love guessing your
    intentions.\r\n\r\n18. When you're designing a website, don't invite any developers
    for brainstorming or design meetings. Make sure we're the last ones to see the
    layout. Show it to the client first, so it will be too late to introduce even
    a modicum of sanity into your work.\r\n\r\n19. We should hang out more, so during
    QA don't use bug tracking software. Come sit with us for an entire day and point
    out changes you want made over our shoulders. Use the opportunity for some impromptu
    design updates as well.\r\n\r\n20. And finally, this is the most important thing:
    don't learn anything about HTML, CSS, JavaScript or browser issues. The less you
    know about it, the more important we seem.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nTaken from <a href=\"http://www.netmagazine.com/opinions/20-things-drive-web-developers-crazy\"

<p>I'll post this here because this blog is less volatile than Twitter:</p>
<p>I fucking hate working with Template Monster templates. To characterize them as lousy would be a huge understatement. I'm imagining the so called "designers" as they throw element after element on the page pretty much freestyle without caring about pixel size, spacing or other stupid things like this. Why should they, after all? Let the poor web developer slap himself when he's on the job and the client expects the work to be done.</p>
<p>That's what I'm doing now...</p>

    I bought the same player one year later. I liked the idea of

    using small cd''s to hold mp3 music and were in euphoria because of a job assignment
    :)

    But with a battery-time measured in minutes and a noise level higher

    than the music itself on normal listening volume,

    it has not been very useful!

    It has finally come to use again, as my employer has banned mp3  in our office
    computers cd-drives! And most my mp3 is self-made from my own cd''s anyway!

<p>Yep! I finally sold my good ol' MP3 player.</p>
<p>"Good ol"? Old maybe, because it was mine since more than a year or something but I can't say it was good. I remember that I saw it on the <a href="http://www.flamingo.ro">Flamingo</a> e-shop back in the summer of 2002 and I had a sudden urge to buy it. Big mistake. Very big mistake! In fact it was the biggest mistake I ever made regarding the purchase of a gadget. The overall quality of the player was rather disappointing. I'm not going to list all the things I didn't like about it because I can't remember all of them but sluggish operation speed, random skipping and the general background noise were the main factors that made me return to my trusty old Sony MiniDisc (which I also recently sold, I mean exchanged for a videocard and some cash) only after a month or so of using the MP3 player. Since then the Waitec was playing CDs in friends' pockets and when I saw I had a possible buyer on <a href="http://www.okazii.ro/catalog/view_item.php3?LotID=423462">okazii.ro</a> I sounded the alarms. After much convincing and praising (no lying though) I managed to sell it to a guy in Bucharest. Today I received the 3.000.000 leis. I feel very bad when I think about the fact that I bought it for 8 million and some but the good thing is I finally managed to sell it. Wheee!</p>
<p>Oh. And if you're ever wondering: <b>DON'T BUY A WAITEC HIPHOP</b>.</p>

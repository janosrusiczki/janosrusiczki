<p><a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/icapture_screenshot.php"><img src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/icapture_screenshot-thumb.png" width="150" height="112" border="0" alt="This site as it looks in Safari 1.1" class="postimage" /></a> Hehe, way cool. There's no need to find e-pals owning a Mac and ask them to take a screenshot of your site, because now there's the <a href="http://www.danvine.com/icapture/" title="iCapture">iCapture</a> site which takes a screenshot of your requested site as it looks in Safari 1.1. You can save the 1024 x 768 PNG image and then analyze it for visual bugs. And all this for free (will be hopefully sponsor-driven in the future)!<br />
My site has some visual faults around the tab links at the top. I put so much work into them to look the same at least in IE and Mozilla but it looks they still don't look OK in all of the modern browsers out there (because frankly who cares about Netscape 4.7 and Internet Explorer 5.5 anymore?).</p>

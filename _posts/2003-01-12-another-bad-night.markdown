<p>Or should I say: just the usual? This time I haven't even been drunk. And still I made an idiotic move. Which makes me feel like shit now.<br />
I had a good day yesterday. It had to end bad. Because otherwise it just wouldn't be me. My faith. My bad luck.<br />
Now it's just the usual bad feeling. I'm beginning to feel weird when I'm not having it. Will bury myself into work as usual just to forget a bit about my misery.</p>

After seeing the great trailers for the really-really promising game <a href="http://www.stalker-game.com/" title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl">S.T.A.L.K.E.R.</a> out of pure curiosity I searched for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> on Google. And through the cached version of a page on Angelfire I reached a site with pictures made by a biker who made several trips to and through the ghost town and it's surrounding area.<br />
The pictures and the accompanying text left me absolutely speechless, just staring at the monitor with a knot in my throat...<br />
Here's the link: <a href="http://www.kiddofspeed.com/chapter1.html" title="Kiddofspeed - GHOST TOWN - Chernobyl Pictures - Elena's Motorcyle Ride through Chernobyl">Elena's Motorcyle Ride through Chernobyl</a>.<br />
<b>UPDATE</b><br />
Ah, as always it turns that the motorcycle ride stuff was <a href="http://www.uer.ca/forum_showthread.asp?fid=1&threadid=8951">complete bullshit</a> and much of the story as well... Ehm, it was a good and emotional read.<br />
Pulse's post on that forum thread was a worthy read and the <a href="http://www.web-axis.net/~pulse/chernobyl/prypyat-panoramic.jpg">panoramic picture</a> he took from the top of the highest building in Pripyat is also worth looking.<br />
What I remember about the accident is that I was a few days older than 7 and I was at my Grandma's probably playing with the presents I got for my birthday on the 17th and when my mother came over we (my cousin and me) had to take some sweety pills (iodide).</p>

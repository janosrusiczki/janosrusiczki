<p>Visiting <a href="http://www.kahvi.org">Kahvi</a> yesterday night after listening for the 1 millionth time to <a href="http://www.kahvi.org/07.html">DiE - Strangest Thing</a> (<a href="http://www.konsumer.de/goodstuff/core.php?part=show_review&showid=66" title="GoodStuff: netmusic guide">reviewed by GoodStuff</a>) I saw that this guy had another release, namely the <a href="http://www.kahvi.org/07.html">Chamleep EP</a> which I downloaded in a hurry (well, as much as I could hurry on dial-up). The first tune of the EP disappointed me a little but the second one is cool. I guess that when it comes to IDM I like more rhythm based stuff and not those chilly "let's-drop-a-bass-drum-now-and-then" kind of tunes.<br />
Now I have to inquire for his e-mail to drop him a few lines...</p>

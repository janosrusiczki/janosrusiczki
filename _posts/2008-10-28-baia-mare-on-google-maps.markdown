<p>Finally, I'd say.</p>
<p><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.310476,79.101563&ie=UTF8&ll=47.654808,23.568764&spn=0.039892,0.109863&t=h&z=14"><img alt="Screenshot of Google Maps with Baia Mare centered" src="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/google-maps-baia-mare.png" width="500" height="327" style="border:none" class="image"/></a></p>
<p>High(ish) resolution photos of all Maramures county (at least as much as I've checked) were added. It's funny that the western third of Baia Mare is represented as part of a nice high resolution tile which was there for a while now, and the other half is now highish resolution too. Can't really see the house I live in, but at least the streets are visible. The other fun part is that the true high resolution part (the third) looks like a really old photo, because for example the <a href="http://www.kaufland.ro/Site/start.htm">Kaufland</a> supermarket is nowhere to be found on it. However, the other one is new as I could identify the <a href="http://www.ambient.ro/">Ambient </a>home improvement store among others.<br />
Another sweet find were <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.310476,79.101563&ie=UTF8&ll=47.659289,23.888612&spn=0.020638,0.038624&t=h&z=15&iwloc=addr">the slopes of Cavnic</a>. Here's <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/blogpics/google-maps-the-slopes-at-cavnic.png">a screenshot</a> for eternity. And this is also a very recent shot, because the <a href="http://www.hotelroata.ro/">Roata Hotel</a> is clearly visible.</p>
<p>But if you're looking for Baia Sprie (Felsöbánya), hehe) <a href="http://www.rusiczki.net/blog/archives/2008/05/30/baia_sprie_from_satellite">my tiled version</a> is still the best you can find on the web.</p>

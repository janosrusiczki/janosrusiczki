<p><a href="http://www.300ad.com/index.php3?u=games/westbang">Westbang</a> is a lot of fun. It's a remake of the ZX Spectrum classic I used to play... Once. More than 10 years ago.<br />
I also updated the only registered game I have, <a href="http://www.brainsbreaker.com">BrainsBreaker</a>. Which is a great jigsaw puzzle game. The best out there I think.</p>

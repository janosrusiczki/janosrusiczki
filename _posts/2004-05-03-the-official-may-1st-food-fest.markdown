<p>Well. It was Saturday, it was the 1st of May and exactly as last year we celebrated food. Not wanting to differ one bit from <i>the picnic</i> of the past year as it turned out wonderfully then, we went to the exact same place. The persons involved were a little different but the feeling was generally the same. In a nutshell: up the mountain - lay down and breathe heavily once we were up - prepare fire - cook and drool while inhaling <i>that</i> smell - finally eat - lay around with a full tummy watching our idiot friends doing some Jackassish pogo thing and holding our stomachs because they hurt after so much laughing. For a moment there I had the feeling it was '69 and I was at Woodstock. Not that I was born or something back then... :-)<br />
The only bad thing was that in the end we had to carry the trash down the mountain and there weren't too many candidates for this job but I managed to forcibly involve some persons other than my girlfriend and myself. We left a clean spot after us only leaving some food remnants and as we sat right under the woods I think animals had no problems finding their way...</p>

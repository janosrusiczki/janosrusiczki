<p>Having nothing else to do (well, not really, since I'm in the middle of a huuuge project) and being annoyed by the fact that the default Movable Type template wasn't displaying correctly in Internet "we are Microsoft so FUCK standards" Explorer I made a new one. I'm done with the front (index) page. Still have to tweak the archives.<br />
And, look Mum no tables! Pure CSS love (except the calendar, hehehe)...</p>

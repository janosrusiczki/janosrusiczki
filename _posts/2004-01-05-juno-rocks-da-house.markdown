The CDs I ordered before Christmas from <a href="http://www.juno.co.uk" title="Finest online record store">Juno</a>. Namely: Adam Freeland's 'Now &amp; Them', Koma &amp; Bones' 'Shutterspeed' and Hybrid's 'Morning Sci-Fi' which includes a bonus DVD. I have to urgently call a friend to borrow a DVD drive.

This package really made my day. And, why not, my week! Although tomorrow I'm going to pick up a double package from <a href="http://www.threadless.com" title="Cool t-shirt outlet, but when will they do a Mozilla compatible site?">Threadless</a> full of &uuml;bercool tees! Unfortunately only two are mine. In fact only one is mine because the other one is a girly tee intended as a gift for my girlfriend's birthday. Anyway, it looks like the Romanian postal service has suddenly recovered from the holiday craze...

I have no real opinion about the CDs yet since I'm in the process of listening to them. <a href="http://www.freeland.fm">Freeland</a> is the first on the list and the bass is rocking my socks so nicely. Yay! A happy-happy day!

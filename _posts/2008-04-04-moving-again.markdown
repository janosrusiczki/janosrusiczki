  content: ! 'Huh, I''ve been pretty happy with them using WP, but mainly because
    they are so generous with space and bandwidth. It increases every month and I
    have 500GB now...enough to backup my MP3s "offsite". Thus I can also run Ampache
    so my girlfriend and I can stream when we are not at home. I would get a dedicated
    machine if I was hosting a professional site, but I''ve been happy enough with
    my personal site on a shared server. Maybe you are just on a busy shared server
    and can be moved? Also, there''s some PHP tweaking one can do as well but I haven''t
    bothered. Your site seems quite quick to me though...

  content: ! 'Consider <a href="http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2008/03/mike-industries-now-powered-by-wordpress"
    rel="nofollow">this</a>, also. MT is not exactly a dream, either.

    On the other hand, I''m on MT and DH, tooâ€”so I''m steamed up as well.

  content: ! '@kit: I know WordPress. Too well, I could say - as I''ve been providing
    support for various installations over the years - plus I have two of my own (<a
    href="http://maramures.link7.ro" rel="nofollow">Turism Maramures</a> and <a href="http://blog.link7.ro"
    rel="nofollow">Link7 Blog</a>). However Movable Type has it''s own magic and elite
    flavour.

    @RS: The pages are quick, but just try submitting a comment. And imagine that
    the whole administration works just as sluggishly. However, I won''t discontinue
    my DH subscription as it works fairly well with PHP. No complaints in this department,
    thank you. Plus the bandwidth, storage space, SVN and the other goodies... MT
    / CGI is a whole different story, though. And I saw how fast it was working on
    TotalChoice a while back when I was still being hosted there. So I''m doing the
    only logical thing: going back. For a few bucks a month it''s not worth going
    through all the headaches of moving to a new DreamHost server, which might be
    just as overloaded as this one.

    Thank you both for your feedback. ;)

<p>I'm on a blogging frenzy! But I'm fed up with Movable Type's sluggishness...<br />
And I know without any shadow of doubt that the culprit is not MT, but Dreamhost and their hosting which is anything but dreamy. Nightmarish maybe, but not dreamy. So I have decided to move back to <a href="http://totalchoicehosting.com/">TotalChoice Hosting</a> as soon as they sort out a PayPal payment issue I just reported after being unable to apply.<br />
If this blog becomes inaccessible during the following days it means that I'm changing nameservers and I'm on my way out of this <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com">crap</a>. At least with this site.</p>

<p>This time to my own server. And the conclusion is that I'm thinking about ditching Movable Type. Sorry, but yes, I'll have to admit it: it's slow as Hell and it was a real pain installing it - I had to tinker with some Apache configuration files to get a damn blog working... That's innaceptable. Don't hold your breath and don't take it as a promise, the grand migration won't happen now nor tomorrow, as I have one really important personal project in the pipeline but as soon as I'll have some "free" time I'll get to it. <a href="http://wordpress.org">WordPress</a>, here I come.</p>

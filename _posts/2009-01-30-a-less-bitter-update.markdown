  content: ! 'My best friend''s father had a very serious stroke a year or so ago,
    as well as my grandmother. Both recovered very differently. The doctors said that
    improvement in the immediate few days and weeks after a stroke were the most crucial
    to recovering faculties so it is very good that your mother could talk so quickly.
    The only thing my best friend''s father could do for weeks was shout out expletives,
    which was a little hard on the nurses. Hope she recovers well...ai de grija, frate.

  content: ! 'She didn''t have problems with talking even from the second day after
    the stroke but she was confusing people and the morning with the evening (this
    could have something to do with the fact that she was sleeping non-stop) among
    other things. Plus the trailing off, which I was talking about above when I said
    "talking weird". Other than that it was OK but I was fearing a post stroke depression.
    However it doesn''t seem to be the case. And I''m truly a lot more relaxed now.

  content: ! 'Hi Janos,

    I hadn''t seen you around online much of late so I came looking for you.  I wasn''t
    expecting to find this.  I''m really sorry to hear about this situation you and
    your mother have landed in.  Don''t really know what else to say...

    Hope you mother keeps improving.

    Take care, Neil.

<p>My mum is getting better. Slowly, with baby steps, but she's getting better.</p>
<p>After on Tuesday evening I cried while visiting her because she started talking weird once again and my father was complaining that she doesn't want to eat and cooperate with the therapist, the day before yesterday my father called me and I could hear the smile in his voice when he said: "wait, your mother will come to the phone and talk with you". And I could hear the change in her voice and it was nothing short of miraculous. From one day to another she went from crazy talk to normal talk and she said she's very happy with the therapist, and that she's very glad that she's being helped and put back on her feet. Finally some good news!</p>
<p>Yesterday evening I visited them and indeed she was much better. Which in turn made me feel much better.</p>

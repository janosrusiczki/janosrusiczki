<p>Since I moved back home my computer suddenly started acting strangely. First of all there are the random resets while writing CDs / DVDs which yield lots of (almost) blanks thrown directly in the garbage - not too pleasant for one's walet. And then more recently there came the strange volume fluctuations which make listening to music a truly annoying experience. I haven't had time to investigate where they come from. It might be the soundcard, the speaker set or some connection between them...<br />
Anyway, screw hardware problems, I just hate them! I want my computer to work and do what I tell it to do. Is that too much to ask? But no, of course there always has to be something weird going on. Otherwise life would be too simple.</p>
